10,26-08-2013,"Nous venons de passer une semaine au Majestic avec notre fille de 2 ans et demi, au cours de la deuxième quinzaine d'aout.
Nous connaissions l'hôtel pour y avoir séjourner il y a 3 ans, avant certains travaux d'embellissements des chambres.
Comme la première fois, nous ne gardons que de bons souvenirs de notre séjour; accueil charmant, chambre propre et fonctionnelle, piscine et décorum plus qu'agréable, ....
Les points noirs restent néanmoins les mêmes : la portion de plage dédiée à l'hôtel reste plutôt étriquée, ce n'est pas le coin le plus propre et le plus beau de la croisette et le tarif transat+collation reste exorbitant. Rien ne vous empêches de vous délocaliser sur les plages publiques à quelques dizaines de mètres, l'eau est la même.
Par contre, sur des commentaire précédents, nous avons pu lire que le personnel est désagréable et ne se montre que peut attentif aux doléances de chacun. Je pense surtout que celui-ci fatigue parfois face au manque de politesse et aux exigences incongrues de nombreux pensionnaires. Quand un enfant de 10 ans se comporte comme un nabab du pétrole et ne connait aucune formule de politesse, je veux bien croire que certains craquent.
Les critiques concernant les prix et tarifs n'ont à mon sens pas lieu d'être, vous savez à quoi vous vous exposez quand vous choisissez un 5 étoiles sur la croisette.
Notre fille ne demande qu'une chose depuis notre retour : y repartir.",barriere-le-majestic,Cannes,France

Lite info av resepsjonist når vi sjekket inn, han var veldig pushy på å prøve å få oss til å oppgradere til høyere romkategori, men glemte å informere om frokost og andre servicetilbud på hotellet. 
Hotellets beachclub var bra, men preget av svært mye støy da det var sliping og høytrykkspyling av piren hele dagen, dette burde vært informert om før man betalte EUR 40 pr seng. 
Dagen etter ble vi anbefalt av resepsjonisten å bruke søsterhotellet sin Beach Club, men da vi kom bort dit var den steng pga vedlikehold... Slik info må man forvente at hotellet har.

8,31-05-2022,"Jeg hadde et helt greit opphold på hotellet, men hvor var luksusen. Jeg forventer meg mere av et hotell med 5 stjerner!!! Selv under Cannes Filmfestival må man også ta vare på “vanlige gjester”. Dette er tydlig et hotel med mange eventer. Ett event settes opp et annet tas ned. Lettere kaos preger en del av hotellets fellesarealer. Eksempel: Når man koser seg med frokosten er det ikke greit med et lass av arbeidere rett utenfor vinduet som demonterer et event. 
Fikk et rom i 7et. som jeg ikke var fornøyd med. ( Hjelper lite med pen innredning når skyvevinduet på veggen er av amerikansk motel standard.
Fikk byttet til et annet rom i 3et. som var noe bedre. Ble ikke “opphisset”.
Ingen blomster, vin eller sjokolade på rommet.
Hotellets gjester har tilgang til stranden/ piret, men ingen rabatt som hotelgjest. Prisene går fra 50-80€ for en solseng m/ badehåndkær. Ikke vannflaske!!! Hotellets gjester burde få en rabatt på dette tilbudet.

10,31-08-2020,"Das Hotel ist wirklich ein tolles Hotel in Cannes, super gelegen und bietet einen tollen Service auch in der Coronazeit. 
Die Zimmer sind geräumig, modern und bieten viel Stauraum. Einzig die Erlebnisdursche in der Badewanne mit der flexiblen Trennwand gibt jedes mal eine Überschwemmung, müsste anders gelöst werden.
Der Zimmerservice hat gut geklappt (Bestellung um Mitternacht) wenn auch erst nach 1 1/2 Std.).
Das Gym ist für so ein grosses Hotel relativ klein, aber dafür mit sehr modernen guten Geräten.
Die zwei einzigen Minuspunkte die wir erlebt haben, war am ersten Wochenende der Frühstückservice. Die Angestellten waren bei dem Ansturm total überfordert und die Gäste (inkl. Wir) mussten 30 min auf einen Tisch warten. Sie mussten sogar dafür die Frühstückszeit bis 10.30 auf 12.30 (!) verschieben obwohl dann der Mittagsservice bereits begann. Dies hätten sie mit Öffnung eines zusätzlichen Saals (vorhanden) umgehen können.
Und der Beach-Club-Service. Als wir am ersten Wochenende an den Privat-Beach des Hotels gehen wollten, hies es alles ausgebucht (ist übrigens der Hauptspruch der Franzosen, egal wo man hinwill), doch wenn wir bar bezahlen würden, hätten Sie evtl. noch eine Liege mit Schirm für uns, dabei waren 50% der Liegen frei, da die Preise absolut überrissen waren (ab 40 Euro/Person/Liege bis zu 120 EUR zu forderst - pro Person versteht sich).

We chose this hotel because there was both a pool and a beach however the pool was not a good experience at all. From around 10.30 it was filled with screaming children with no precautions taken by parents/children during this pandemic. Children by the pool is not something that the hotel could do anything about obviously but good to know for other visitors. Prices in both pool bar, restaurant and beach were exceptionally high (even for Cannes). Paid 21 euros for a few slices of watermelon... Had lunch at Fouquets, the only vegetarian option was bland and tasteless yet at a high price. The beach restaurant had better food but service was poor (upon arriving we were completely ignored, seated then ignored again for 30 minutes before anyone took our order). The beach was okay but there are better options on the croisette (with cleaner water). All in all an okay hotel but there are better options for the prices. Might be a better option for families than for couples/friends/business.",barriere-le-majestic,Cannes,France

Vi skulle få VIP fordeler gjennom hotels, men er usikker på hva dette er.
De ansatte i resepsjonen sa det var tilgang til svømmebassenget, så mulig Bassengområdet ikke er inkludert i prisen. 
Servicen ved bassenget er litt treg til tross for lite å gjøre. Og det er heller ikke mange solsenger, så vær tidlig ute hvis du vil sikre deg en. Hotellets strand har solsenger både på brygge og sand mot gebyr på minimum 50 euro per person, så vær obs på at det ikke er mye inkludert i prisen du betaler for hotellrommet.

2. The staff could not have been more attentive and helpful, every person we interacted with did so with a smile and pleasantness:

3. The room was modern, comfortable, well furnished, clean, I literally don't know what else you could need from a hotel room.

5. The pool area was clean and well maintained. Staff at the bar/pool were always available and happy to help.

4,6/8/2018,"Once i checked in it was 8 pm, i got a room which is not what i payed for (lower) i requested to change the room they said no rooms available today maybe tomorrow.. so i waited the next morning to get a room and i got a better room ( size wise) i payed extra 200 euro per night to get this! at 5 pm i got the room because again they were cleaning and preparing the room .. when i got to the room it had a leakage from the ace with a stain in the room dripping .. when i called they said they will send someone to fix , at 11 pm also it continued dripping, when i went to the reception to complain the manager was SO BAD that he didnt want to solve the problem claiming that their is no rooms available and he will send a professional guy to fix the ace and he wants us to stay in the room and deal with it!! I requested my money back to go to any other hotel .. he literally went inside the office didnt want to talk to me .. so i got stuck with the room for the night and at the moring ( 3rd day ) i got a decent room at least .. it was the worst experience!!",barriere-le-majestic,Cannes,France

6,26-07-2018,"We came for our first anniversary, which we mentioned to the hotel; nothing was done to make us feel special, which was unusual for a 5-star hotel. Room was old and decaying - lots of peeling paint and gross build up in the tile and grout. Rain shower and hand held shower had low pressure, I couldn’t even get out my conditioner, and water was spraying out of the handle. 

Got strange bites during my first evening and believe they were caused by bed bugs. I calmly and privately advised the hotel, who said “sorry” but did not seem overly concerned and did nothing to make up for the issue.

Overall, unimpressed. This hotel was not 5-stars and certainly not worth $800/night.",barriere-le-majestic,Cannes,France

I sat at a table waiting to be addressed to take a drink/food order for over 30 minutes and finally left the pool lounge area. Parking, private beach fees were near double other 5 star hotels along the beach. Just did not provide the value I was looking for in a 5 star hotel. After I complained and heard other guest complaining as well, they offered breakfast for two days, however, breakfast had already passed so we took free breakfast for one day and it was a good breakfast but not if we paid the price they were asking, $55/person for breakfast??

When I was booking the hotel after paying lots of money for three nights the add was saying free room with the Sea view in March and April as I didn't get it but was offered to pay extra £100 a nigh for a room with the sea view! 
When went to the terrace bar on quite few occasions the waitress took a long time to serve a drink and that was only I have asked tree to four times to be served! The same thing happened in the restaurant! Was very disappointed! The gentleman was sitting on the table next to me and he couldn't wait any more and after half an hour he just left! Lots of staff around but no service at all! On one of the night we decided to have a drink at the bar after the dinner in town! We walked to the bar and three waiters are talking to each other without acknowledging us! Only after 3-4 minutes as waiting and demanding service we got the drinks but we have it to carry our own drink to the tables which are they by the way dirty and filthy !

I understand this is a 5 star hotel but to charge €44 for breakfast served on a side plate was astounding to me! 
Another disappointing feature is a man who stands outside the hotel and checks bags as you enter.  It felt intrusive  to have my bag checked every time I returned to the hotel (often 5 times a day!) -most unwelcoming to your guests!
Then the occupants of the room next door (which had an adjoining door)started to smoke in the room which filled my room with the smell of cigarettes.  In the morning the smoking started up again!

When I see a photo of a room on hotels.com I expect the room to look like that.

Upon checking out it was I who had to ask for compensation ( received 300 Euro off our account) otherwise I wouldn't have received anything.

The front desk were excellent but we found service at their beach area terrible and at a cost of 130euros a day for two sunbeds it was definitely not good value. Noise is a problem in the guest bedrooms facing the pool. They had loud outdoor entertainment until 2am on the Friday and Saturday which meant you could not sleep until it finished.

That is my only criticism. We could have moved the car but we felt a bit embarrassed so we left it there for the night (we didn't want to look cheap).

Our first room (not the most basic) was nice but too small and overlooking the noisy a/c units below. All they could offer to get a quieter room had to be via a paid upgrade which made the stay more expensive than planned. The private beach is a ridiculous price and the pool area is pretty small so no guarantee of a spot to sit.
Generally got the feeling that there were differing levels of service depending on 'who you are' and how much you are paying which sadly attracts some of the more obnoxious members of wealthy society but that said, it generally pretty good.

Every single person we encountered during our 5 night stay, from the bell boys, to the concierge, to front desk and housekeeping were friendly and efficient.

6,19-08-2015,"Top notch hotel. Very high end service. Lovely rooms with impeccable finishings in the updated rooms. One HUGE downside is that even on the 6th floor facing the ocean and pool* it sounded like we were in the middle of a nightclub from 8pm-2am. HORRIBLE! Ear plugs didn't do a thing to help and the windows on the 6th floor were vibrating from the music! The restaurant downstairs turns into one and its patio outside becomes the dance floor in the front courtyard for the ""want to be scene"" smoking crowd... Staff was quite apologetic and got us another room on the side of the hotel with no view and was a lesser room but was quieter. One suggestion to the hotel- limit the nightclub to indoors or shut down the 1000db music after a reasonable hour. If the unforgivable late night noise issue (it is an expensive 5 star hotel after all) was solved we would have given this a higher overall rating.

The hotel lobby and room standard are great, but we were dissappointed by the other facilities. Particularly the fact that the hotel charges €32 for half day by the pool plus €32 for half day at the beach (per person). In addition the pool is really small, packed with kids, does not have sun in the evening (5pm-ish) and 0.5l beer in the pool bar is €20. When checking out we found out that the hotel had charged us €45 per day for parking without informing us in advance.

We had a host of issues with this hotel, from room cleanliness to the staff ""misrepresenting"" things to us. Forgetting our negative experiences: their beach while ""private"" is between 2 public beaches and is much less desirable than others on the croisette and their pool is fine but through the summer they have private events seemingly all the time even by staff accounts so if you want to swim in the midst of a cocktail party.... I would not stay here again.",barriere-le-majestic,Cannes,France

Problèmes résolus assez rapidement avec un ""va et vient"" du passage du personnel technique.
D'autre part EXPEDIA devrait indiquer qu'en saison hivernale, il ne reste qu'un restaurant, le restaurant HORIZON au sommet du bâtiment étant fermé.
Au cours du séjour soit après 2 nuits passées à l'Hôtel, nos cartes/Clés ont été désactivées dans la journée sans nous prévenir : à l'accueil, on nous a indiqué qu'il n'y avait pas assez de garantie de paiement !! en invoquant un bug électronique pour justifier la désactivation ensemble de nos 2 cartes/Clés, ce que bien sûr, nous n'avons pas cru !!

Quelques bémols plus ou moins important. 20€ de supplément pour avoir la wifi ce qui est simplement scandaleux vu le prix de la chambre, un plateau déjeuner qui est resté dans le couloir de l'après midi au lendemain matin ce qui est anormal pour ce standing d'hôtel et des cafés ou cappucino qui sont infects !!!",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

10,11/9/2023,"The hotel is in the heart of monaco, I’ve been staying in this hotel for many years, it’s in need of a major renovation.  The entrance and lobby are very 1980’s.  The rooms are spacious but nothing fancy, compared to the neighboring hotels.  I left items in the room upon checkout and I received an email
With pictures of my items to come and collect or they can ship to me, front desk are professional.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

6,27-08-2023,"Stuff very friendly, location great and central, but entire hotel very dated and despite renovated rooms. Breakfast on the rooftop restaurant Horizon with great view and good choice of food (buffet), but very crowded. Overall not the quality you would accept for a Fairmont chain.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France
4,25-08-2023,"During our recent stay at Fairmont Monte Carlo, our experience was unfortunately far from satisfactory. This review aims to provide an honest account of the issues we encountered, including a concerning incident involving a pipe on the balcony, poor communication, a breach of safety protocols, and an unreasonable charge for pool access.
To our dismay, we discovered a pipe on our balcony that appeared to be releasing what seemed to be feces. We immediately reported this issue to the hotel staff, expecting a prompt resolution. However, it took an alarming two days for the hotel to address the problem. This delay was not only inconvenient but also unsanitary, as it exposed us to potentially hazardous substances during our stay. Furthermore, the hotel staff initially denied that the substance was feces, which further added to our frustration and disappointment.
To inspect the situation on our balcony, the hotel staff entered our room in our absence. Regrettably, they left the balcony door open, which is a significant breach of safety protocols. Not only did this compromise the security of our belongings, but it also raised concerns about our personal safety. The hotel should prioritize the well-being and security of its guests by adhering to proper procedures when entering occupied rooms.
We were taken aback by the hotel's policy of charging $55 per person for pool access. As hotel guests, we expected to be able to enjoy this facility as part of our stay without extra costs.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France
10,3/8/2023,"Fourth time we have stayed there, this hotel does not disappoint. The staff are wonderful, the room was so comfortable and the hairpin view was stunning. We will definitely be back for the fifth time, hopefully soon.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France
6,1/8/2023,"FUTURE GUESTS BEWARE: 

1) Hotel is right next to a large scale construction site which is not mentioned anywhere prior to booking. We booked our room facing the Mediterranean Sea and got assigned a room facing the sea as well as the not so nice construction site.

2) We booked this hotel due to the availability of an outdoor pool. However, the pool area is part of the Nikki Beach concept and hotel guests only have access to a few sunbeds cramped behind the bar. Adding to that, the pool is not cleaned and in the morning we found ourselves swimming with bits of old food from the previous night's party. Staff couldn't care less and excused themselves with ""the robot is out of order"" and only when speaking to the hotel duty manager, it was possible to clean it.. 

Too little, too late, and we checked out early. We will find another place to stay next time we're in Monaco.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France
10,30-07-2023,"This is a gorgeous hotel, situated with views of the marina or famous hairpin turn.  We chose the latter and were truly impressed with the view.  We spent hours on the balcony watching Monte Carlo in motion.  The front desk staff were helpful and the Horizon Rooftop restaurant afforded good food and better views.  We did room service breakfast and that was also fantastic.  The location was also convenient, close to the beach, casino and car museum.  
The pool was refreshing and provided great views from the 7th floor, but was geared more towards local partiers than vacationing families, and I hope the new pool under construction will alleviate the crowding.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

2,26-07-2023,"Construction taking place every morning so I couldn’t sleep, would’ve been nice to know that when I arrived. They couldn’t move me to a new room so I had to just deal with it. AC went out for two days as well. Beautiful hotel but not getting any sleep because of construction was really disappointing.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France
2,23-07-2023,I booked online with expedia and paid 750€ per night. My friend came with me and booked a room on the spot at the hotel and paid 430€ for an even better room.

Great restaurants, including the pool area restaurant. Very close to the casino 5 min walk and 10 min walk to marina. Be sure to use bug spray in the evening-mosquitoes.There was no night time entertainment, it’s pretty quiet at night in the hotel. My room was clean every day with fresh towels. There’s no private beach access. Overall, it was satisfying for the family.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

6,8/6/2023,"The property is extremely dated. When paying almost $2000 for two nights there are certain expectations. Our original room had stains all over the carpets, stained tub, a worn out chair and was right below a room undergoing construction. It smelled of cigarettes and was disgusting. They hassled the room change even though it was still early claiming no rooms available. The room they put us on was much cleaner. But know they will also charge you €10 for ice. Thanks a lot Fairmont for the disappointing experience at Monte Carlo.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France
4,31-05-2023,"There is a huge tower block being built next to the hotel which not only blocks the view but is also very noisy. The staff are very attentive if you are wearing Prada or Armani but less so if not (we tested this out). The pool loungers cost €220 a day! The pool also has constant Euro pop playing.

6,23-09-2022,Picked this hotel because of the pool. When you log onto the site it’s their opening photo. It looks amazing. What they don’t tell you is hotel guests are pushed to the very back of the pool behind a screen. You can’t even see the pool from there and there is no service. If you want to sit by the pool you need to pay 180 euro. So when we checked in on Monday at 3pm we headed straight to the pool. The entire area around the pool was empty and the area at the back for hotel guests was packed. Made no sense.,Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

Toppen av kransekaka var at det var slosskamp på nikki beach(takterrassen) og ingen av betjeningen klarte å stoppe dette. Det ble kastet flasker på øvrige gjester. Skandale!!!!!

4,18-06-2022,"Fantastic location. Staff brilliantly helpful and service and food great.

8,16-06-2022,"My mom and I stayed at this hotel as part of our French Riviera road trip in June 2022. The property was lovely, and the staff were attentive, as expected by a Fairmont. However, a few items worth noting: Firstly, two large new buildings are being built in-front of the hotel on the water-side, which means both loud construction noises continuously and also views of the water are partially obstructed by construction. Secondly, the pool at the hotel is part of the Nikki Beach Club. If you want a spot anywhere near the pool you have to pay for beds and bottle fees, if you are a hotel guest you a free lounger crowded together in an area where you cannot see the pool and near the construction so it is all you can hear; this also gets very very busy on the weekends and you may not get into the pool if not booked in advance. When we were there, the hotel was doing a promo shoot by the pool and pulled one of the free loungers by the pool to look like that’s where guests are situated but it’s untrue and deceptive marketing. Lastly, the hotel is also not on the beach as pictured. However, there is a private shuttle to and from the private beach and the concierge and Fairmont beach staff accompany you the entire time during transportation so this was actually a wonderful experience for us. It’s also worth stating that the entrance to the hotel is right on the corner of the  famous hairpin turn so it’s always busy and not easy for in and out driving your own car but the valet help!",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

Never in all my years of travel have I ever come across a receptionist so determined not to have your repeat custom.

Nobu restaurant is definitely worth a visit, but not so much the others on site. Service from staff is generally reserved for those turning up in a Ferrari and staying in a high end suite, midrange customers can feel somewhat overlooked. The hotel is maybe better suited to the “see and been seen” crowd than those looking for a relaxing break with good restaurants and beaches on the Côte d’Azur, but maybe that can be said for Monaco in general.

10,28-12-2019,"チェックインからチェックアウトまで全てが完璧な、とても快適な滞在でした。

閑散期であったため、チェックイン時に格安でスイートへのアップグレードの提案を頂きアップグレード。３時頃の到着だったのですが、部屋の準備が出来るのにあと１時間弱かかるため少し待って欲しいと言われ、「ラウンジでゆっくりして下さい」ということでドリンクチケット２人分を渡されました。

日本人スタッフがおり、日本語で少し会話。クリスマスなので付近の店はほとんど閉まっているのではないか、レストランなど予約するならお申しつけ下さいとのこと。フランス語も英語も使いこなす初老の非常に紳士的な、カッコいい男性でした。

海の見える素敵なラウンジでウェルカムドリンクを楽しみながら待つこと30分少し。つけあわせのオリーブなどもとても美味しく、快適な時間です。部屋の準備が出来た頃を見計らってチェックイン。

部屋はコネクティングタイプのスイート。ベッドルームが１つ、ダイニングルームが１つです。ここでトラブル発生。コネクティングのはずが間の扉の鍵があいていない。フロントに電話をすると、ものの５分もしないうちにスタッフが空けに来てくれました。海外系のホテルだと電話してからスタッフが来るまで３０分ほども待たされることはザラなのに、非常に対応が素晴らしいと思いました。

部屋は至って快適。他国の５つ☆ホテルにもたまに泊まりますが、遜色ない・それ以上の快適さ。オーシャンビューで海が見えるのが素晴らしいのは当然のこと、夜になると赤・黄・緑・青にペイントされた海側の建物の屋上がライトアップされ、これが夜の真っ暗な海に映える。近くの港に停泊しているクルーザーの明かりがまた何ともお洒落。普通、オーシャンビューって昼の景色は素晴らしいが夜は真っ暗ですよね。夜まで景色が楽しめるのは、さすがだなと思いました。

クリスマスだったこともあり、付近のお店が閉まって居そうなのでルームサービスを選択。やや高めではあるものの、クオリティは最高。コブサラダ、ステーキ、チーズバーガーをオーダー。付け合わせのフランスパンのバゲットもとても美味しい。総額で1.5万円ぐらいだったと思います。

明け方、朝日を見ましたが、空がピンク色に染まる様子はとても幻想的・ロマンチックでした。外に出ても１２月なのに全く寒くない。バスローブのまま、ベランダのテーブルでサービスのシャンパンを楽しみました。

閑散期だったのでリーズナブルに宿泊出来ましたが、繁忙期だと恐らく３倍ぐらいの値段だったんだろうな…と思います。冬のモナコ、おすすめです。ぜひ訪問してみて下さい！",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

8,19-10-2019,"Friendly hotel, but you need to get used to the pacing.  The check in process took about 25 minutes.  Nothing was wrong, simply it takes the clerk time to type in an incredible amount of information, while amicably talking to you about the features in the hotel.  My booking was through hotels.com, so they had all the information, but seemingly, there was a bunch more stuff they had to input, not just for me, but for everyone it seems.  Not unlike opening a new bank account.

The view of the sea includes alot of new construction in the harbor.  Means there will be a mix of sleek yachts, tug boats, barges and barge mounted cranes.  It's actually pretty interesting.  The days I was there a barge mounted crane was erected, and they were grabbing these huge boulders and building out the sea bed.

The comforter in our room was discovered to have stains from someone breakfast on it, and was promptly replaced.  Laundry was expensive, but prompt and well done.  The concierge team was friendly and knowledgeable.  

We found the best and most interesting food at Cafe de Paris, and easy walk from the hotel.  Take the elevator to the 7th floor, and knock about 10 minutes off of the time it takes to walk there.

The pool is nice, not so pretentious that you feel you don't belong there.  Clean and well attended.

Overall, I'd come back and stay again.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

Cleaners do not clean the black mildew in between the tiles.  This is a pricey hotel as the location is amazing right next to the Monte Carlos Hotel but hotel does need improvements in these areas.

Lange Warteschlange bei Check in... wir hatten zwei Kinder dabei darunter ein Baby und waren bereit einen Zuschlag fürs früheres Check in zu bezahlen aber das hat das Hotel nicht hinbekommen... nicht mal ein Getränk wurde uns angeboten ... das Zimmer war groß und sehr sauber. Das Bett einfach fantastisch! Babybett war auch gut und sicher. Das zustellbett für unseren großen war nicht so bequem, die Matratze war ziemlich billig und schlecht. 
Am Pool war die Bedienung bzw. Begleitung zu den liegen sehr unhöflich... ich musste warten mit einem Baby auf dem Arm, bis die Dame auf uns kam. Sie hat uns angeblich vergessen wobei wir die ganze Zeit vor ihrer Nase standen und warteten... 
und was mir besonders nicht gefallen hat dass man für so einen teuren zimmerpreis kein Frühstück inklusive haben konnte... Frühstück hat ca 40 EUR pro Person gekostet ... finde sehr übertrieben. 
Es gab noch einen Transfer zum Strand für 35 EUR pro Person inkl Liege. Aber man kann in 10 Minuten zu Fuß zum Strand und ohne liegen ging es auch. Es ist ein Kiesstrand, war sauber und ganz schön. 
Die Lage vom Hotel ist super! Es gibt genug zu sehen in der Nähe.

Location aside, the property oozes luxury; from the moment you walk in you can tell it’s a 5 star stay. Every member of the staff was super friendly and professional and really gave us the celebrity treatment, which definitely made a difference. The pool and restaurants were amazing, and the room was gorgeous. The only negative from the stay is that there is significant construction going on near the water on the east side (some Marina Extension project or something). We had splurged on a sea view room and unfortunately ~70% of the view has construction in it (which was also noisy during the day), so that was a pretty big disappointment especially after paying so much for the view, which would have been absolutely stunning otherwise (although still was nice). The construction can also be seen from the restaurants and pool on the 7th floor. This is nothing the hotel can really control so nothing against it but just a word for the other travelers who get the sea view room - you will see cranes and barges!",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

The breakfast (not included in our booking) was worth every penny! Properly cooked streaky bacon and a chef-cooked omelette at the roof-top restaurant, what more could you want?! Well whatever that may be, I’m sure they have it! The views are amazing and the location is super for exploring Monaco. Staff are as you’d expect. Their bar, the Nobu restaurant and the Sun Casino are all downstairs so if you don’t need to leave the hotel one night you don’t need to and have an interesting night!",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

Paid for more for the ocean view upgrade and chose the hotel for that reason. Unpleasantly surprised to have off shore drilling all night and bright lights fr the cranes.  Hotel manger was nice enough to include a complementary breakfast buffet which was nice.  I just didn’t get the experience we had hoped for with an ocean view in Monte Carlo.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France
2,22-09-2018,"O Hotel é bem localizado. Quartos são bons. Mas para mim pecam forte em pequenos detalhes. Vou citar três situações que vivenciei em apenas uma diária: a) cheguei no hotel as 13 horas e pedi se podia fazer check in. Embora houvesse quarto disponível o atendente falou que somente seria possível após as 15 horas ou eu deveria pagar uma taxa. Ressalto que é uma prática bem comum em hoteis deixar fazer check in antes se o quarto esta disponível. Na mesma viagem parei em outros dois hoteis muito bons (Chateau De La Chevre D Or - Eze e Negresco, Nice) e em ambos os casos foi possível. b) solicitei um quarto silencioso pois estava com  bebe de seis meses com dificuldades para dormir. Acontece que me colocaram em um quarto que fica um andar abaixo do lobby, e havia uma festa naquela noite. O barulho de batidas de salto no teto somente parou as 1 AM. c) fomas para a piscina as 10:30 AM. Quase não haviam hospedes na piscina. Acontece que mesmo assim as únicas poltronas que eu poderia sentar eram bem distantes da piscina e sem sombra (horríveis para quem esta com um bebê). As poltronas envolta da piscina eram pagas. As seguintes ja estavam todas reservadas. Enfim, embora fosse a piscina do hotel os hóspedes só podem a utilizar plenamente pagando taxas, ou solicitando reserva prévia de cadeiras. Completo absurdo. Obviamente não é uma experiência que será repetida.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

10,6/9/2018,"Our 2nd visit to the Fairmont last week was just as brilliant as our first trip there 3 years ago.  

From the personal welcome by the manager, to the beautiful room, the comfiest beds, and the professionalism and friendliness of all the staff - it was all perfect and I couldn't have asked for more. 

Nikki beach at the rooftop pool was so serene in the morning and the music was a perfect blend throughout the day and evening. 

The management here is serious about customer service and everything has been thought of and works like a well oiled machine.  
The hotel is a 1970s looking building but in an iconic way and it's interior is well maintained and super clean and swanky. It's location is just behind the casino so it's ideally located for strolling around this beautiful part of the world. I would thoroughly recommend anyone to stay at the Fairmont if they are looking for a high end treat.  It's ranking as a 4 star hotel would be better reflected as 5* - it really is a special place.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

6,4/9/2018,"We were excited to stay here especially since it’s supposed to be a nice hotel chain. It was also part of our honeymoon and the hotel we splurged the most on. Overall, we were disappointed with the hotel for the price. The rooms or at least our room we found to be pretty outdated. The furnishings look old and the bathroom looks the same. I’ve stayed at many other hotels that are also 4 Star that are much more updated and luxurious feeling. The hotel is big which is probably the best feature - it has a pool, 3 resturants and a nice gym. I did also have two treatments done at the spa and was also disappointed given my expectations for the chain and the price of service. I understand in Monaco/Monte Carlo everything is much more pricey but in this case, you might be able to find a better (smaller/lesser known) hotel for the same price.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

4,31-08-2018,"The pool has been transformed into a day and night club with loud music and packed full of young pretty things getting drunk and smoking. You can’t use the pool area fir sun bathing unless you pay over 100 Euro and buy expensive drinks. So if you thought you’d like a gentle dip and a pleasant book read on your sun lounger, it’s not going to happen. Floor 6 rooms in that area will suffer from the noise too. So unless you like swimming in a club! AVOID! 
Btw management response on trip advisor is that this club even is ‘the’ place to be I’m Monaco. Well I’m glad it brings you fortune and that sort of clientele, but it’s damaging to the reputation of the hotel and is not what Fairmont customers want.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

It took over 1 hour to check-in, we booked a king room and were sent to a room with two twin beds.  When they corrected their mistake, they sent us to a smoking handicap room but did not mention either!  We were forced to change rooms a third time, which was finally correct.

8,18-08-2018,"Pro: posizione, servizio in camera, colazione, disponibilità del personale 

Contro: camera, servizi extra

nel complesso lo valuterei un buon hotel, ma l’esperienza non vale il prezzo richiesto. Hotel non offre nessun tipo di servizio e/o piccola attenzione nei confronti del cliente se non ad un ulteriore costo aggiuntivo. La colazione e la vista panoramica di camere/ristoranti e piscina è sicuramente il loro punto di forza, tuttavia la Moquette delle stanze risulta essere trascurata e macchiata, sicuramente non un buon biglietto da visita per un 4 stelle. Il parcheggio è a disposizione dei clienti al costo di 60€ al giorno, così come l’acqua in camera rigorosamente a pagamento a cifre piuttosto esose. 

Non mi sentirei di consigliare questo hotel solo ed esclusivamente per il rapporto qualità prezzo decisamente troppo eccessivo per gli standard offerti. Sicuramente la struttura non vale il prezzo richiesto.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

One caveat for us though is the pool was our biggest draw when we booked because it’s beautiful and overlooks the sea. It does look like the photo  BUT, it’s like a Las Vegas nightclub from10:00 AM in the morning and all day and night.  So it’s completely inappropriate for young children.  This was very disappointing for our kids.  The hotel did shuttle us each day to the beach, but we had to pay for our beach chairs - which is normal.

6,21-07-2018,"We stayed for just one night at the end of a two week break. Staff were very attentive and friendly throughout our stay. 

The F&B and public areas of the hotel are fantastic! We had a blast in the pool and enjoyed all of the different restaurants and bars. Used the spa for a manicure which was great although I wouldn’t fancy a massage as the music is very loud from the pool party above! It also overlooked a balcony which looks dirty and sad, with one pot plant.

We were offered if we wanted to upgrade our room for a sea view, but we declined and were so pleased as we had a perfect view of the f1 hairpin! 

There were 3 of us in the room, we were offered a cot for my daughter that we refused as we had two beds in the room which was fine, but there was no attempt to make any provisions for the 3rd person in the room, children’s amenities would have been nice but we at least expected a towel! 

The rooms are very dated. They have not been refurbished or upgraded to match the quality of the hotel. Bathroom is marble, which is lovely but then they had old fashioned electrical items such as hairdryer and corroded torch, what looked like an accessible stool, washing line across the bath and a minimal display of amenities. 

The decor, and bedroom again felt very dated, although was fine for our needs if not a bit small. 

Check out was slow, and systems were down, so no bill presentented.

4,17-07-2018,"From our trip to Europe we were expecting the Fairmont to be the most lavish of all of the location as it Monaco.  Unfortunately it was the worst, we ended up leaving a day early as we had enough. Don’t waste your money on ocean view rooms, you will see fishing boats and drilling out your window. Nothing magical. The Horizon restaurant which is on the top floor of the building took 20 minutes for a waiter to swing by to take a drink order in the crazy heat in July. The waitress then procedes to breaking a champagne flute near us where the shards of glass hit my husband arm and almost his eye. They didn’t broom the area where the glass shards fell which made me nervous if there were any little children. Nor did the waitress apologize or ask if we were okay. She rudely poured our drinks with major attitude on her face and body language. After we complained, the next waiter told us she was having a bad day.  After this episode, our room was ready so we went there. The hallways look like a outdate cruise ship. The rooms have not been renovated. Even the alarm clock is from the 90’s.  Not what to expect from a 4 or 5 star hotel. We knew we would be paying premium pricing for Monaco but this was them taking extreme advantages of their high end clientele. 60€ for parking a day. Cocktail drinks were in the 20€ -25€ each, a club sandwich would run you 25€, but to pay premium pricing you expect great service and nice accommodations. Unfortunately this hotel felt like a 3 star.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

I could stay there for a week and not get bored. The views was beautiful, right outside the Fairmont hairpin if your an f1 fan. The cleaners did a great job of house keeping, beds were super comfy, you just melt in and fall asleep straight away. Food wise, lunch I would recommend the Horizon for a nice lunch with scenic view. The best part was Sunday Jazz Brunch at Saphir 24 restaurant. Champagne buffet €89 but this includes everything you would want to eat with a great selection of appetisers, seafood, poultry meats to dessert! Just beautiful and enjoyed it with a great live jazz band.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

The lodging, service personnel and dining experiences are scored as perfection, and in my opinion are rated better than similar such prime lodgings located in Las Vegas, London and Hong Kong.

Parking anywhere and everywhere in Monte Carlo is very difficult, but Fairmont can handle or suggest a savings alternative if you want to climb many steps. Room placement could be important, I probably should have asked for a better location or pleaded for an upgrade but our 2 night stay just wasn't enough of an issue for me to pursue a more picturesque room or more updated style.

The check in process was very slow, and the check out process was even worse...about a 30 minute wait. The majority of the staff at the resort were not friendly. Staff at Nikki Beach pool were rude and unattentive; valet staff were snobby and were not friendly or welcoming, and they did not even open the door for us once while they were standing in front of the doors; staff at horizon never came to clear our plates at the breakfast buffet until there was a large pile of dishes in front of us; the bell boy was the only person that was friendly and took time to explain the amenities of the hotel and suggest some nice places to go in the area.

They would not give us the King bed non smoking room, and moved us to a two beds, non smoking room. Claimed that there were no more rooms left in the ""600 room"" hotel. Meanwhile the entire hotel was empty on that weekend. The hotel manager did not seem to care at all.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France
8,15-07-2017,"We booked the Fairmont for its sea view position, we had been to Monte Carlo before and knew the Hotel.
We think that the decision to have Niki Beach in the roof top pool area is a poor decision and would not encourage us to return to this hotel personally.
However we always review honestly, this hotel has great staff in all areas, the rooms are spacious and clean, with modern bathrooms. Comfy beds.

The location is perfect for visiting Monte Carlo, it's right next door to the Buddha Bar, so I think this area is now being aimed at the younger market.
There seemed to be lots of stag and hen nights around over the weekend we were there.

The reason I marked down for condition and facility is that in certain areas the hotel looks in need of some refurbishment.

The concierges were so helpful when booking tours.  Enjoyed the pool.  Great housekeeping service.  Comfy beds.  Food great.  Very friendly staff.

8,30-06-2023,"It was a beautiful hotel with a spacious and comfortable room. However, the hotel really missed a trick when they decided to put shutters in front of the balcony doors rather than having standard curtains inside – and the balcony door could not be closed from outside either. We had booked with a balcony due to me being an early riser and my husband not so much but due to the above, I wasn’t able to use it at all while he slept. I found this to be a really, really bad mistake from whoever designed these.

Staff by the pool were always good to come and take your drink order when you first got there, but anything after the first one, we had to seek them out ourselves every time.",Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France

6,10/5/2023,"I travel quite a bit for work and spend about 40 days a year in hotels rooms. I have never had such terrible and dismissive service in a hotel or even a hostel (and yes I have stayed in many hotels across France). I may never book another Hyatt.

1. My airline misplaced my luggage and was going to deliver to the hotel later that evening (I arrived to the hotel around 3pm). I was told to follow up with the concierge. The concierge never bothered to call or let me know it had arrived later that evening (I did call down a couple of times to check). I ""found"" it the next day along with luggage for some other poor victims of this hotel. Unacceptable level of service for a hotel of this price/category.
2. Hotels.com noted I was paying extra for a ""sea view"" which was not true. My view was completely 'obstructed'. I was located on the 8th floor and my view was of the noisy pool/terrace and concrete beam. The sea was not visible. 
3. I asked for a late checkout as I needed to take a work call and was refused in almost an abusive manner. The horrible rudeness of the hotel staff was not acceptable, the seemed to enjoy treating me like I was garbage and refusing my request. In the end the rudeness was without reason --- as the lovely cleaning staff told me ""no worries"" I was able to stay the extra hour, take my call, and left at 1pm without issue.",Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France

8,6/4/2023,"We loved the building and the renovation/restoration work.

The hostess said they weren't seating and to come back in 10 minutes but order at the bar.  I did as she said, and when I asked the bartender for a Diet Coke, she said she was very busy and I would have to wait for her to make drinks for two tables that had been seated.

Service at pool for drinks VERY slow.  Non-attentive wait staff. Never came around and asked if you wanted a drink or snack. One MUST all but stand up and waive a server down to place an order. Drinks were good but expensive. 
BEWARE of the coffee…7 Euros for a half cup Americano… I ordered three never dreaming of that price…but I ordered them, drank them so felt I shouldn’t complain about the cost…however, it is excessive.

If you can specify a sea facing room as our balcony looked out into a “grass” balcony and other buildings to the back. 
Staff were really friendly and bar was quiet, although we couldn’t go outside by the pool

Front desk people were helpful but Greg in Concierge was as good as they come.  He spent time on locating a pharmacy, airport transfers, restaurants , Carnaval tickets, train schedules and more and never seemed in a hurry despite always being busy.  I didn't eat at the restaurant but there were always patrons and especially on Valentine's Day when they put out extra tables and they were all filled.  Something must have been great.

Nice touch was the integrated Chromecast in the room TV, meaning we could e.g. watch live Breakfast TV from home even if we were in France! 
The hotel could be summed up by quoting one of the taxi drivers who stated ”this is the best hotel we have here”.",Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France
8,2/10/2021,"Nice location, service was so-so, servers in breakfast buffet restaurant were sort of rude about things. Example. I set my plate down and went to get juice and when I came back he was removing everything from the table and said these are for the restaurant. There could have been a kinder way to handle it I thought. Other then that I enjoyed the facilities. Small but solid fitness room and indoor pool. I would stay there again and just get my breakfast else where. Oh and be sure you look at the “partial Sea view” before they talk you into upgrading for 50 or 60 euros a night.

8,15-09-2021,The building itself is gorgeous in a FANTASTIC location.  There were TONS of restaurants in a five minute walk…10 minute walk to old town and across the street from the Mediterranean Sea!  For 5 star…the rooms were a rather normal hotel rooms…nothing spectacular but were nice.  The bed was fine and I am a bed snob.  The separate toilet and bathroom was nice.  I also liked the separate shower and tub.  We were perplexed that there were not black out curtains to later to find there were blackout shutters externally on the windows.  They were electric and very easy to use.  The only negative thing to say is about the toiletries provided.  These are small things but the soaps and shampoos were mediocre.  Not a big deal at all.  I am not sure if this is a Nice thing or not but they toilet paper provided was downright painful.  I mean like a torture chamber terrible.  I will know this next time…Cotonelle will be traveling internationally.  If that’s the only negative…we are doing great!  I had a spectacular time!,Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France

10,20-07-2020,"Man sollte das Frühstück unbedingt erwähnen. Es wurde viel zu lange an einem personalisierten Service „gearbeitet“..!!
Es macht keinen Sinn ohne Teil-Buffet zu arbeiten. Die Platzierung war viel zu lange. Es ist kaum zu glauben, was passiert, wenn das Hotel voll sein wird
Covid-19 erklärt dies nicht wirklich. Wenn ein kleines Buffet aufgebaut wird, dann kann man noch immer eine Mitarbeiterin zur Hilfe hinstellen. Um ein Spielei zu bekommen dauerte es 25 Minuten. Zwei weitere Pfannen hätten da wirklich geholfen. Die Mitarbeiter waren wirklich sehr sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Nur „too much is too much“. Es hilft nicht, wenn dafür 30-40 Minuten Zeit gebraucht wird. Der Chef im Abzug hätte dies besser koordinieren müssen, statt selber nur abzuräumen. Der Kaffee war kalt, man hatte das Gefühl möglichst schnell gehen zu müssen und als Businessman fühlte man sich in einem Hyatt Regency fehl am Platz.
Es gibt wirklich viel zu tun beim Frühstück, da dies der Tagesstart ist nicht wirklich überzeugend..... Nizza..? Ich erwarte mehr..!!

10,11/12/2019,"It was overall a lovely stay. It was a bit difficult booking a hotel for Nice, France when so many reviews were saying that for each star attached to a hotel to bring it down by one star because the hotels are not up to par. I would have to agree after visiting and seeing other hotels that were on my list to potentially stay at. But this hotel was way more than I expected. The reviews are accurate and I am so glad that they were, this hotels views are gorgeous (I booked a twin double sea view) and it was phenomenal to step outside on my  private balcony and look at the sun rise or set. This hotel is perfect to stay for any season. It has a indoor pool leading to the outdoors, it has a sauna and is along the Promenande des Anglais. Short walk to Old Nice (very short) and the hop on, hod off bus tour is a stop right across from it. If you get the breakfast added to your stay you won't regret it, it's really good and some of the nicest hotel staff are there.

8,19-10-2019,"So we have never been to Nice before, and this was the first city of a multi city trip that had an American hotel chain (Hyatt) offering.  The price was quite a bit lower than the nearby French hotels.

The hotel entrance is a narrow revolving door next to a larger casino, but once inside, it's expansive.  However, once you are in your sea view room, you realize that you are actually set back another 200' and you are actually overlooking a terrace and pool below you.  Your view of the sea is somewhat obstructed by annoying facade that makes up the false front of the building.  

That's all pretty minor though once you are outside.  There's a gorgeous seemingly endless boardwalk along the beach.  Places to sit, shade, and full access down to the water.  It's well lit at night and full of local folks out for a walk.

Many restaurants within an easy walk, as well as high end shops followed by affordable boutiques on Alphonse Karr street.

Food was surprisingly affordable as compared to Monaco, or Zurich.  

While our stay was great, I think I would give one of the French hotels a shot next time, if I could afford one of their sea view rooms.

8,5/9/2019,Hotel was much better 5 years ago.   It now looks like it needs some maintenence.   Overaall cant complain.   But relative to the money paid you expect a lot better service and room condition.    This hotel now is at best an average hotel.,Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France

8,29-08-2019,"The hotel is very nice, but too expensive for it's value.",Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France
10,29-08-2019,"Näyttävä hotelli kaikilla mukavuuksilla ja hyvällä paikalla, ehdottomasti hintansa arvoinen. Henkilökunta oli ammattitaitoista ja mukavaa, huone pidettiin siistinä ja yöpyjistä pidettiin huolta. Huonepalvelun kautta tilattava aamiainen sekä yksityinen ranta palveluineen olivat aivan huippuja! 
Hotelli oli muutoin siisti ja yleellinen, mutta käytävistä tuli enemmänkin mieleen risteilyaluksen hyttikäytävät, kuin luksus-hotelli.",Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France
4,27-08-2019,"We were pretty disappointed with this hotel, given its price and reputation, and we cannot recommend it to anyone.

1. We generally thought that the service was lacking, with the notable exception of the concierge staff. For example, when checking in we informed them that this was our honeymoon and we barely received a congratulations and it ended up being the only place we stayed where we didn't receive a detail because it was our honeymoon. 

Similarly, we once asked for a specific table in the hotel restaurant and were told we couldn't have it because it was reserved, but no one came. The night before check out we asked what time we should leave for the airport and the clerk said ""When you wish"", which was typical of our experience, and then they called a cab for us, but didn't explain how much it would/should be, so we ended up paying 60 euros for a 15 min ride. Service was also generally slow. 

2. The room was generally comfortable, but the hotel's architecture is strange, so very few rooms have a clear view of the beach, and our room was obstructed by the hotel's columns.

3. The amenities in the hotel were also pretty lacking. The connected indoor/outdoor pool and gym facilities are relatively small, the sauna facilities didn't really seem to work and the restaurant was just OK.

Pros:

1. The hotel partner's beach (Sporting) is good (but it requires an extra fee and service was bad).

2. Location.

3. Concierge staff

It may be good for Nice but we can't recommend it",Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France

8,7/7/2019,"Hyatt Regency Nice Palais de la Mediterranee is a beautiful property in a stellar location.  Concierge services are outstanding and deserve the highest praise.  The restaurant 3e was delicious and set with a spectacular view.  Our room was small and dark and not as well appointed as Hotel Martinez in Cannes, but satisfactory.

Services only fell short at the front desk.  On check in, we received a trainee who was given no guidance and therefore gave incorrect information and took a prolonged time.  Check out was even more frustrating.  The hotel experienced difficulty processing payment and the front desk staff was both rude and arrogant, blaming the issue on the cards of both myself and my companion.  (Ridiculous as we have two completely separate accounts and both credit companies explained it was a hotel issue, they had not even received a charge let alone declined payment).  This debacle made us late for our flight and though the hotel rectified the issue later in the day independently of anything we needed to do, we received no email indicating that or apologizing for the confusion and delay.  Better training of staff and treatment of guests is necessary at a property of this caliber.",Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France

I liked that because I'd booked for 3 adults in a room with two double beds that the hotel made sure there was three of everything. It was also nice to have a kettle in the room with tea and coffee provided.

6,10/5/2019,"Bei der Anreise mit dem Auto verpaßt man leicht die kleine Auffahrt und befindet sich dann auf der Taxispur. Der vom Hotel angebotene Parkservice für 30€ am Tag funktioniert leider nur etwas schleppend, d.h. man wartet meistens etwas zulange auf seinen Wagen. Das Hotel selbst ist nicht sehr attraktiv. Durch die Erhaltung der alten Fassade ist der Meerblick extrem eingeschränkt und der Blick auf die anderen Hotelzimmer wirkt grau und unfreundlich. Die Balkone sind ungemütlich, grau und  haben eine schmutzig wirkende Umrandung, die Bestuhlung ist sehr einfach. Die Zimmer selbst sind ok, aber nicht besser als 4 Sterne. Das Zimmer war sauber, aber es hat schon ein paar Jahre hinter sich, eine Renovierung wäre angesagt. Das Verdunkelungs-Rollo funktioniert elektrisch, aber zwischen den Lamellen blieb stellenweise Platz, was am Morgen durch gleissende weise Lichtblitze das Schlafvergnügen störte, da der Vorhang nicht zum Zuziehen geht.

4,27-03-2019,"We were slightly disappointed in our stay at the Palais, while the facade is gorgeous, the stay went downhill from there.  Overall, the hotel feels like a watered down American hotel that is posing as a French luxury hotel. The French hotelerie staff is wonderful and very professional, exactly what you would expect, but they do not run the whole hotel. We had several encounters calling the front desk to get someone who spoke neither English or French (we are both bilingual).  Additionally, we asked for the mini bar to be emptied, were told it would be for a 10 euro charge and it never was. Finally, the room was never cleaned very well, glasses were left dirty from one day to the next, and our robes were taken and not returned, which is a problem since hotel rules require that you wear one to go to the pool. The carpets throughout the hotel are stained which is rather upsetting. 

The breakfast was not very good and very overpriced. the Espresso comes from an electronic machine and overall the breakfast feels like something I would get in the states.



While the rooms are comfortable and the view is phenomenal, overall, I would not recommend staying here, either save your money and go someplace that charges for what it actually serves or pay a little more and stay at the Negresco.",Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France

10,19-10-2018,"The room and the lobby were very nice.  One warning.... It is a tough place to drive in to.  There is not a drive up spot that is easily accessed.  And one more note.... When they say your room has no view, they mean you will be looking into a number of nearby residents' balconies.  You will want to keep the curtains shut!",Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France

If there is one star that doesn’t shine as brightly, it would be the unsyncopated attention in the dining room. The wait staff makes itself, hmmmm, I shall say “unobtrusive” but that’s not convenient when there’s a tour to catch. But don’t misunderstand: The food is excellent and when tending to one’s table, the staff is finessed. Definitely would stay at the Hyatt again for both  the hotel itself and its location.",Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France

8,5/9/2018,It was good but not great! No dark curtain in the room so we had to put up with the lights at night & the daylight in the morning. We did not get much sleep & it was a pitty because the beds were so very comfortable. Beds were amazing! All the staff was excellent! Very good service. Shower was also reallybad.

We had the facility to leave our bags at the lobby and walk around Nice on the last day despite our check-out being at noon time and our flight being in the evening. Kids did enjoy the pool a lot.
I would not rate the in-house restaurant as high quality as the service was left desiring. We had dinner the last night and the staff/service was all over the place. The restaurant costs do not justify the quality. Apart from that it was great.",Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France

10,19-08-2018,Great hotel - excellent location in the heart of Nice right across from the beaches. Rooms are spacious and breakfast was excellent!

Spa tarkoitti huoneeseen tilattavaa hierojaa. Allasalue toiminnallisesti heikohko. Aamiaistilan sisätilat hyvin ankeat, mutta aamiaistarjonta suht ok. Hotellin sijainti rannan tuntumassa ja lähellä vanhaa kaupunkia hyvä, mutta toisaalta vilkkaasti liikennöity Promenade des Anglais ja liikenteen meteli.",Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France

10,26-06-2018,"The location is right on Promenade des Anglais, east of Place Massena and just west of the Old Town. For us, it was perfect! Check-in was very smooth (our timing at the dinner hour may have had something to do with it). Charlotte and company at the Front Desk spoke English and Spanish very well. The room was well-appointed with a balcony that is actually usable. The partial ocean views overlook the open area above the outdoor portion of the pool. If you look at the front facade of the property, you see pillars and below floor 6, you are looking through these pillars at the sea, still lovely, but not totally unobstructed. 
Breakfast was tasty, well above average, but not free on our particular rate. The young man making the omelettes (sorry, forgot your name) was attentive and his creations were perfectly done! It is a good option if you want a more hearty meal than coffee and croissant. 
And the last thing that will have me returning to this property when in Nice again? I left a credit card and commuter card behind in the safe. The front office and guest services staff contacted me the following day after we checked out. They were willing to send the cards to my home, but, in the end, it was easier to have them destroyed. This was handled very professionally with confirmation that a) I wanted the cards destroyed, and b) that they were indeed appropriately disposed of.

6,6/6/2018,立地は良い．ただし，価格に見合わない設備内容と部屋の広さ．たまたま角部屋に当たったが，これが他の同価格の部屋より狭かった（ただし，その分バルコニーは広い）．なんだか損したような気持ちになった．3泊したうち，2回目の掃除ではふだを置いていいないにも関わらず，リネン交換はなし．コップやティーカップなども洗っていない．備え付けの冷蔵庫には飲み物があらかじめ入っているが，これがセンサー付きなので，ずらしたりするとその時点で課金されるとの注意書きがあり．ホテルに頼んで冷蔵庫をからにするには一泊あたり10ユーロかかるとのこと．冷蔵庫一番下の段にかろうじて500mlのペットボトルや350mlの缶が入るがそれ以上のものは入らない．朝食内容は普通の割に高い．雰囲気料もしくは眺め優先だと思えばまあこんなものかと．リゾート系のホテルなのである程度はしょうがないと思うが，2度目の宿泊はない．,Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France

Mon fils de 3 ans pouvait à l’aide d’un petit espace entre les balcons passer de l’un à l’autre. Mais dans l’ensemble je recommande cette hôtel.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

10,20-09-2019,"La situation de l'hôtel, à proximité de la gare principale, est très attrayante. Les chambres, fonctionnelles, sont très bien insonorisées et confortables, bien que relativement petites. Le prix payé était surfait, mais vraisemblablement dû à une manifestation particulière à Genève (la Rod Laver Cup) au moment où nous y avons passé une nuit.

Que l’on me demande une pièce d’identite Je trouve cela normal, que mon cardex ne soit pas sauvegardé en mémoire l’est moins. Je suis Directeur d’Hotel et les agents de reception utilisent les données des clients à chacun de leur séjour.

Je pense revenir.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

4,7/2/2019,"La chambre réservée avait une ventilation défectueuse (bruit excessif). La femme de la réception, interpellée à 19H30, m'indique que tout est normal et que cette ventilation s'arrêtera automatiquement à 20H30 et qu'ainsi, je n'aurai aucun problème pour dormir au retour de mon dîner. Mais ... à 23H, c'est la même chose et l'homme de la réception m'indique qu'il y a un problème et qu'il va tenter de me trouver une autre chambre. La première proposée présente le même défaut. La seconde est un peu moins bruyante et je l'accepte bien qu'elle soit minuscule. Le lendemain, au check out, la personne de la Réception m'indique que le Gérant connait le problème et s'occupe de le régler. J'en suis ravi mais je suis mécontent de mon séjour.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

1st cleaning lady (which is ok obviously :), 
then 30 minutes later someone to check the mini bar, 
then a bit later someone to check if the AC is working correctly? 

The shower head was connected with some malfunctioning or damaged flexible hose, which only let the water trough if mounted to the shower holder, otherwise it would get compressed and affect the water flow.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

10,28-06-2023,"This hotel is situated in the heart of Geneva, just a minute's walk from the main train station, Gare Cornavin. The room at this hotel was of a decent size and had a proper bathroom, unlike those modern or trendy hotels with bathrooms featuring glass doors and sinks in the middle of the sleeping area. During our five-night stay at the Warwick, we thoroughly enjoyed our experience. The services provided, along with the attentive staff, contributed to our overall satisfaction.

2,2/6/2023,"DONT STAY HERE. INSECTS IN THE BED. If I could share ZERO stars, I would. I checked into this hotel on the night of 29 May. I was escorted to a room with a door smaller than the rest of the rooms in the hallway, only wide enough for my one checked luggage to fit through. I requested to be moved to the proper room, which they obliged, but only after claiming this was technically an upgrade (IT WASNT — it is the room I originally paid for. A classic room). Nonetheless, i didnt complain. As I got ready for bed, I moved the pillows and blanket out of place only to find 8-10 small insects buried underneath (see photo of what it looked like). These insects also flew on me throughout the night. I called the reception and told them id like to check out and request a refund and they said I would have to handle this with Expedia, who I booked and prepaid the four nights with. There were also no available hotels at that time for me to go to (it was midnight). I waited until day break and went down to the reception to tell them what happened. They very nonchalantly told me there were flies during this time of year. Upon calling expedia to resolve the matter and get my money back for the nights i didnt stay there, the hotel refused. DONT STAY HERE unless you want bugs in your hair and clothes. I’m still waiting for Expedia to get back to me on resolving the issue. So disappointed in how well this hotel is rated on Expedia.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

I and others in my party complained of the same problem.  The thermostat on the wall did not seem to work and consequently it was a bit on the warm side. The saving grace was the the fact that you open a vent style window to cool it down.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

My issue came to the service staff cleaning the room and the front desk staff as well.  I asked for my room not to be cleaned, I had only arrived the night before.  Upon returning to the hotel after a few hours, my door was standing wide open and my makeup bag was been pilfered through, all my brand-new Lancome makeup was gone.  I immediately reported it to the front desk, they didn't seem overly concerned at all merely discounting the trivial loss as if it was a bother to them. It was the principle and the violation that something out of my room was, in fact, stolen, yet there was a complete disregard.  Upon my return to Geneva, I'll find somewhere else to stay to avoid a repeat.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

4,18-08-2022,"Aside to location and general conditions of the property, it was a horrific experience.

We had made some purchases and locked them well inside our luggage. One night while we were back at night, we realised our hotel door did not close properly!!! 

As we had some purchases, before we went out on the morning, we always ensure the door was properly locked. So we immediately went in to check to ensure everything was still intact.

We proceeded to make a feedback to the reception as most likely, the house keeping personnel did not lock properly after tidying up the room. I highlighted the importance as well to be more careful in future. Since nothing was lost, I did not pursue further.

But the receptionist first reaction was blaming to the hotel door and myself as she said sometime the door has to be closed harder. She was implying it was my carelessness. They did not perform much service recovery nor apologetic.   I expected more from them after a brief moment of traumatic experience!",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

One minus - we did not receive a Geneva Transport Card; when inquiring at the desk they said it would have been sent via email, but I did not find anything, including in spam filters.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland
10,25-07-2022,"Hotel was excellent - great location, clean, comfortable and service very good. Breakfast choices were very good, including cooked options like bacon and scrambled eggs.

8,13-07-2022,"Hotel was great with respect to location to the Cornavin train station. There is a lot of restaurants and shops within walking distance. The hotel concierge gave me a card for free public transportation (you have to ask for it), but the card lets you take any bus, tram, train, etc. for free! The only negative experience with the Warwick Geneva is that the AC is not really good. There's no number indicating the temperature of the room, and it's not clear which way you should actually turn the dial. The room would have been great if I was able to make the room a bit cooler. It's a bit surprising that such a nice hotel has such an antiquated AC unit.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland
2,12/7/2022,"The most terrible hotel in my life. The toilet was not flushed, so used toilet paper was in there. The hair dryer was not working. Some of electricity outlets were not working. Room was small. Only one thing I liked was 1-min distance from the main station.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland
8,2/7/2022,"Good location, close to the main train station and only a short walk to the lake. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Room was very clean, but could have done with updating, as curtains, carpet etc. look a bit old. Main issue was that the aircon was not that strong and it was over 30C on a couple of days that I was there, so got rather warm in the room.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

8,31-05-2022,"Great hotel
In front of the train station and Migros supermarket and surrounded by restaurants - so lots of choice! 
If doing day trips to other cities - handy to have train so close by. 
Train journey is 7min btwn hotel and airport.  
20min walk ro Jet D'eau 
Given free public transport card around Geneva, for duration of your stay when you reach the hotel. 
Bed is soft and comfortable - pillows are a bit too soft for my liking. Good size room. 
Air conditioner - felt too cold or too hot, found it difficult to control over the 4 nights. 
Hotel buffet - lots of choice, good selection of food. Was expensive, but all food is expensive in Geneva! 
Noise level is minimal considering next to a train station - slightly noisy on occasion at night, but NOT loud enough to keep you awake. No noise in the day - the windows do a great job. 
Would definately recommend this hotel.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

Within walking distance of the lake/downtown and the free transportation card they give you can get you to any of the highlights in town. Very friendly and helpful staff, we were first time visitors and they helped point us in the right direction for everything and answered the various questions we had =] The room was also surprisingly large eventhough we didnt book any kind of upgraded room or anything so that was a nice surprise, and the USB plug was definitely helpful!",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

10,20-03-2022,"We had a great experience at the Warwick Geneva. The location is located right across the street from the train station, so we were in close proximity to everything. The hotel was clean and the staff was very nice.
As Americans, we are use to having AC everywhere and it was warm in our room. The hotel staff instructed us to open a window to let cool air in (FYI: Late March timeframe). However, since you are in the heart of city traffic, it was a loud night’s sleep. But we powered through thanks to jet lag. We would stay here again and recommend this hotel to family and friends.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

Fiquei em hotéis de alto nível na mesma viagem, como o Estherea (Amsterdã) Splendid (Paris) e Opera (Zurique), dentre outros e isso nunca aconteceu.

Trains, trams and buses just in front of the hotel so it's easy to get around! While staying at the hotel, you will get a Geneva transportation card for free, so you can use public transport for free! The lake is within walking distance (approx. 5-7 min) and many restaurants and bars near the hotel! Very close to UN and WTO too! 
Only drawback is (like in other hotels too) poor choice of pillows! Furnishing is used but okay! Definitely worth staying!! High recommendation!",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland
10,12/10/2021,"I highly recommend Warwick Geneva Hotel Stay as it has close access to all public transport. Right at the center of the city and close to most of the local tourist spots by walking.

The beds were very comfortable. The room had big windows with view to the transtation area. Very convenient location with a shoping mall in the basement of the same building, including Migros, Denner, KFC and Mc Donald. 

Only negative would be that the water pressure in the sink and shower was a bit low, and it was hard to regulate the temperature in the shower with hot/cold levers instead of a single temperature regulation.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

Das Bad ist eher klein, insbesondere auch die Dusche, und man verstellt dadurch u. U. unfreiwillig die Wasserhahnen (weiss man es, kann man sich drauf einrichten). Das inbegriffene Frühstück ist durchschnittlich gut, das wichtigste ist vorhanden, für 4 Sterne hätten wir uns noch etwas mehr Auswahl/Abwechslung gewünscht.
Die zentrale Lage beim Bahnhof ist sehr gut, man ist in wenigen Minuten beim Zug oder bei Autovermietern, und ebenfalls in wenigen Minuten ist man zu Fuss am See (von diesem Zimmer sieht man nicht auf den See, ist aber für uns irrelevant, da für uns die zentrale Lage wichtig war und wir schnell zu Fuss am See waren).

2. However, I don’t like cleaning service overall. I stayed 5 nights but sometimes they forgot to refill amenities and arrange stuffs(ex. Iron). I asked concierge again but they didn’t. Also, it was annoying that trying to clean the room early in the morning(around 8 Am) without checking whether customer is inside or not. I really don’t understand that this is 4 star hotel’s service. We were 2 people and they gave us 2 bottles of water on the first and second days, but after that days, they gave us only one. It seems to me their service is incomplete.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

15:00チェックインですが、ホテルに14:30に到着。部屋を準備中だから20分待ってと言われました。準備できたと案内されたのはバスタブなしの部屋。すぐレセプションに戻り、バスタブ付きの部屋をお願いし、変更はしていただけましたが、まるで特別に変えたかのような返答でした。それでもバスタブ付きの部屋にしていただけたことは感謝しています。
バスタブ付きの部屋は、駅前なので広くはありませんが、設備は充実しています。部屋はきれいです。
このバスタブ表示については改善していただきたいです。バスタブ付き浴槽ではなく、バスタブまたはシャワーにするべきです。そうすれば最初からバスタブリクエストをするか、または別のホテルにします。

最後に、レセプションのスタッフはチェックインの際に、wifiサービスや朝食が何時からどこで食べられるのか、と言った一般的な説明は一切ありませんでした。",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

8,8/3/2019,"위치: 제네바 기차역(Geneva Cornavin)의 대각선 맞은편이라 이동이 굉장히 편함. 역을 나와서 횡단보도만 건너면 호텔임. 주변에 Migros, Coop 같은 마트가 있어서 식료품 사기에도 편리함.

객실: 침구가 정돈이 잘 되어 있고 깨끗해서 잠을 편히 잤음. 슬리퍼가 있어서 신발 벗고 지내기 편함. 

직원: 직원들은 대체로 친절했음. 그러나 breakfast 결제 과정에서 약간의 문제가 있었음. 객실에 breakfast가 포함되지 않는 방이었고, 그래서 따로 요금을 내고 먹기로 함. 이 과정에서 데스크 직원이 29프랑을 25프랑으로 할인해주겠다고 했음. 그런데 다음 날 아침 식당에서 bill에 가격이 29프랑으로 찍혀서 나왔음. 그래서 식당 직원에게 호텔 데스크 직원이 할인해주겠다 했었다고 말하니, 25프랑으로 수정해줌. 하지만 호텔 체크아웃 때 breakfast 가격이 또 29프랑으로 결제됨. 결제된 영수증을 보고 문제를 얘기했더니 이미 결제된 요금에서 4프랑을 돌려주겠다고 함. 신용카드에서 실제로 4프랑이 환불됐는지는 확실하지 않음. 왜 부서나 직원들끼리 소통이 안돼서 고객을 번거롭게 하는지 이해가 안됨. 

로비: 도어맨 직원이 친절했음. 체크아웃하고 로비에서 짐을 챙기고 있을 때 로비 데스크에 있는 만다린이 맛있으니 가져가서 먹으라고 함.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

Very comfortable - if you can, stay on 7th floor in one of the Penthouse Terrace rooms. They have balconies which are very nice and the views are great.

Only one bad thing to say:  when we checked out, I did not review the bill as well as I should have.  We were charged for an $8 jar of nuts from the room snack bar that we never ate.  I think the previous guest in the room must have eaten them and it went unnoticed when the room was cleaned for us because the peanuts weren't there when we checked in.  They showed up on day two of our stay and we got charged with the missing jar.  Not a deal breaker, but I don't like paying for something I didn't use/eat.  I should have paid closer attention to the bill but we were in a hurry and the line for the charge was in the middle of the other charges and I missed it.  Oh well, $8 for an otherwise perfect stay is okay, I guess.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

6,2/8/2018,"Check in時, 提供了良好的服務 &周邊景點/交通介紹, 房間也很乾淨整潔~
Door man還主動提供雨傘方便雨天出門~
但入住的隔天中午, 櫃台打電話來要求我 ”Pls check out now,  because you only stay 1 night”,
我解釋了我是入住兩晚, 昨天在櫃檯也是支付兩晚的房價(有收據),
飯店給我填的入住資料也是兩晚, 飯店提供的免費交通卡也是三天兩夜~
但對方還是很堅持, 他的電腦資料就是only stay 1 night.
僵持了很久, 櫃檯才發現他弄錯房號了!!!!!! 然後只簡單說了Sorry就掛電話!!
這完全不應該是一家好旅館該有的態度和允許的錯誤. 在心中已經大扣分!
因為有公事要處理. 所以我大概13:00左右人還在房間內, 
聽到有人敲門, 我才起身, 還沒走到門口, 對方就衝進來了!
原來是房務要檢查min bar , 我可以接受日間有房務需要進房間,
但敲門後至少要隔個3秒鐘才能進入房間吧? 
敲門後1秒鐘立刻衝進來, 我還沒來的及披上衣服, 一個男生就衝進房間,
實在是非常難接受這樣的教育訓練",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

Pro: Room Service incl Frühstück auf dem Zimmer, Bademäntel und Slipper, ordentliche Kosmetikartikel, Wasserkocher mit Kaffee/Tee auf dem Zimmer, uniformierte und höfliche Angestellte usw. - Contra: Mobiliar, das 1982 richtig luxuriös war, zentimetertiefe Teppiche im Zimmer, ""alter"" Luxus usw. Wie ein altes Hilton, Sheraton usw. Die Lage direkt am Bahnhof in Genf ist komfortabel, und die Zimmer sind ausreichend groß mit kleinem Sessel in der Ecke und Mini-Schreibtisch. Das WLAN ist ok.

It is across the street from the train, tram, and bus station and only 2-3 blocks from Lake Geneva. So many wonderful restaurants to choose from within walking distance. We would definitely stay there again. The staff were incredibly helpful and prompt.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland
8,31-03-2018,"The superior rooms start from 4th floor. Had such difficulty getting upper floor although paid for it. This is probably due largely to the lady concierge than anything, selective of what requests to respond to? So, insist politely. Also, had the no disturb sign on the door, yet the housekeeper still tried to come in. Good thing I had the bolt on. Was coming out of shower!!!... The best part, other than the location, was the bar tender. He made the lobby bar a great stop for closing the day and before going up for the night. Pleasant, welcoming, professional, efficient. Left my gloves and he had them safe on our return the next night.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

8,21-02-2018,"Stayed 16th to 19th February as a long weekend break. Hotel well appointed, friendly and efficient (apart from the Restaurant).  
The only issue we had was with the Teseo Restaurant, booking made for the first night we were there. My wife and I both ordered the same fish dish - only part of one was delivered at first - for some reason they thought we were sharing!  On questioning this the waiter said the rest would be coming soon - 5 - 8 minutes later still nothing and the part dish going cold.  Caught the waiters attention and clarified again two separate dishes and to take away the cold dish.  Surprise, surprise one portion of chips arrived on its own, and about 4 minutes later the two dishes and finally after another few minutes the last element of the  meals arrived.  Totally unacceptable and very annoying.  
The restaurant was run by one busy waiter and with it being full he could not provide the level of service required - it really needed a second waiter.
We did notice others in the restaurant having difficulties getting the waiter's attention and some just got up and left.  We only had the first course and we gave up.
For the rest of our stay including breakfasts we ate out - there are some very good eating establishments providing very tasty, very good value meals with much better service.  
I don't usually write with issues or complaints and to be fare we may have been unfortunate with our experience, however it did taint our, up until then, good experience.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland
10,19-02-2018,We needed to book an overnight stay in Geneva which was close to the train station to enable easy travel by train to Sion next morning. The Warwick is a 2 minute walk across the street from the main station entrance and even at 11pm this felt a safe walk. The check-in was speedy and we were delighted to have a penthouse family-sized room with an amazing view from the balcony. After a very comfortable sleep we awoke to a panoramic view of the city which included snow. The breakfast was amazing - a huge choice at the buffet complimented with delicious hot drinks including hot chocolates. I absolutely recommend.,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland
10,17-02-2018,"May son and I had a great week skiing and were very tired.  From the doorman's welcoming greeting to the friendly and knowledgeable reception \ checkin, we felt relaxed.  It was completely hassle free.  The gentleman that checked us in was very helpful, with a map of the city, places to see, free bus transportation, and train transportation to the airport.  We could not have been happier with our brief stay.  This will be our first choice in hotels for our future travels.

The room was very clean and the beds were comfortable.  We felt well rested for the our 22 hr journey home the next day.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

Nadeel was dat de douche in het bad was en voor mensen die wat meer aan de lengte zijn ( Ik ben 1.90 ) niet echt fijn douchen is. Tevens fluctueerde de temperatuur van de douche regelmatig van warm naar best fris. Het ontbijt is maar tot 10.30 uur",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

We had continental breakfast  one morning and the full menu the next day,both were very good,the fresh croissants were amazing. It was maybe a little pricey but then its to be expected in a 4 star hotel in Switzerland.

The hotel is across the road from the station and so convenient. The staff were pleasant on both occasions. ~On the second stay the price was significantly higher than the first. Also they had sprayed some chemical down the corridor to our room and in the room itself. It was toxic and got on our chests so that we had to sleep with the window open. They didn't offer any reduction in the price as a result even though we reported it at the desk. Overall, I wouldn't go there again.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

The room was spotless and the view from the balcony was breathtaking. My partner said he had the most incredible nights sleep and I couldn't agree more - the mattress was comfy, the pillows were amazingly fluffy, and the room was lovely and warm.

There continental 'bar' breakfast was also lovely, and we got much more than we expected for the price we paid.

I had a nice view of the plaza in front of the train station from my window, but unfortunately, that meant that people on the plaza had a nice view of me. It was a tad far from the touristic center of Geneva but convenient if you were taking the train (like me). I didn't eat breakfast at the hotel, finding it too expensive (like most things in Switzerland!) and instead went to this lovely place called ""The Cottage"" about a seven minute walk downhill. The staff were helpful and fluent in English.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

4,23-02-2017,"I stayed at the Warwick for a week in February 2017. The hotel room is clean and comfortable (the bed and pillows are great !). The hotel is located conveniently across the Cornavin stattion, so transport to all sites and places is super easy (this also makes the front facing rooms a bit noisy !). 

Overall the stay was below average as the staff interactions were not always pleasant and in some cases I was made to feel as if my presence was a bit of a hassle for them. The check-in was brusque and I was informed of ""problems"" on my reservation that were never followed up. For both my reservations, they did not offer a queen bed in spite of the hotel not fully booked and I had to pay extra to the next category to get a larger bed. While the rooms are comfortable, the bath area did have some black mould on the bathtub area.  They are also renovating some of the rooms and this can add a bit of noise if you are staying  the room during weekdays.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

Remember to collect the free train ticket from the airport ticket machine while waiting for your luggage to arrive. The service at the hotel was excellent. Our room on the 7th floor was much better than we expected. Great view over the city with the mountains on the background (not the Alps, though). Big balcony, more like a terrace. Had breakfast at the hotel every morning, food was fresh and good, nothing special but the atmosphere at the breakfast room was nice and the service was great. The proximity of the railway station and the bus station made it very easy to travel to Montreux and France (day trips to Chamonix and Annecy)... or just about anywhere. Will definately choose this hotel again when we come back to Genève. Merci beaucoup!",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

6,31-08-2016,"The hotel was located adjacent to the main train station and a ten minute walk from Lake Geneva. While not the most scenic area of Geneva, it was central to almost anywhere and easy to get around on foot. The staff was extremely friendly and went out of their way to help us during check-in. The room was clean, and would have been fine had it not been for the air conditioning. The air conditioning did not work, or it worked only a little, because we could hear it come out but did not feel a change in temperature. It was very hot in Geneva while we were there, and the room felt unbearably hot even after keeping the curtains closed all day long. This made sleeping extremely uncomfortable, and my friend and I could barely stay asleep at night because of the heat. This hotel would be fine to visit during the winter or cooler months, but needs to fix their a/c situation during the winter, as I would not be able to stay in that room again in warmer weather.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

Vi valde att uppgradera till buffé en morgon, den var ok men inte i paritet till priset. Vår vistelse fick ett tråkigt slut, då man försökte ta fullt betalt för samtliga frukostar, vilket skulle inneburit en extra kostnad på över tusen kronor. Utcheckande receptionist kunde inte ""se"" att ngn typ av frukost skulle ingå alls.

Caso tenha um vôo pela manhã os trem começam a rodar a partir de 04:40 da manhã, sendo que o tempo até o aeroporto é de 10 minutos, o que elimina a necessidade de se hospedar em um hotel perto do aeroporto. Além disso, fica próximo das principais atrações da cidade. O quarto é de um tamanho bom, mas no nosso quarto haviam colocado uma cama de solteiro (ou ela ficou do hóspede anterior), o que diminuiu muito o espaço para as malas. O banheiro possui um bom tamanho. O quarto e o banheiro estavam limpos. A recepção nos deu uma mapa da cidade e nos orientou sobre como chegar as principais atrações da cidade, o que embora não fosse necessário (eu já sabia o trajeto) foi um toque agradável, já que não tive essa atenção em nenhum outro hotel. Todos da recepção com quem tratei foram atenciosos e não tive nenhum problema com o hotel.

8,2/6/2015,"Hotel is very nice. Room 214 is clean, and service is good. Only negative is a design flaw of the hotel,windows. Room 214 catches the afternoon sun which heats the aluminum window frames to a point where they are extremely warm, almost hot to the touch. It is like have a radiator running full blast in the summer. The room air conditioning is inadequate to handle this heat problem. The room is extremely uncomfortable until early morning. Suggest not book a room in the front side of the hotel until winter",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

8,9/5/2015,We liked the hotel. It is only a two minute walk from the railway station. The staff is hospitable and very friendly. Despite a long queue at the reception on arrival it took only a couple of minutes to get the keys to our room. What we liked most is that we managed to check in earlier and that we could borrow an umbrella every time we went sighseeing. All in all  we are pleased that we chose it for our stay.,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

You get a free public transportation ticket for your stay which is convenient. We rented a car for a couple of days, and there is a garage just around the corner. You validate your ticket at the reception. There is also a choice of continental and buffet breakfasts.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland
8,4/5/2015,"Our check-in was fast and the staff very pleasant as well as efficient. Unfortunately, the room was not ready and we waited quite a long time in the lobby.  They explained that  they had had a large checkout.  The room was on the 1st floor and had a street view which was interesting in the day time.  However, at night, one could hear all the cars and the party goers up until 2-3 am.  I am sure a higher room would be much better.  The carpet seemed new and all the furnishings were very modern.  The  bathroom was well supplied.  There was lots of   underground shopping was right under  the building as well as across the side  street.  The street cars ran right by the door and the big Geneva train station entrance  was about 1/2 a block away-- so easy for the airport transfers.  Tour company ticket booths, Lac Leman  and the fountain were a few blocks away. The big shopping area an easy walk as well.  The Front Desk gave us a voucher for free local travel on the public transportation.  This could used to go to the airport on departure day. I would recommend this hotel.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland
10,16-07-2023,"I was very impressed with this hotel, especially the service. They make you feel special and you feel like everything is possible. Special shout out to the Kidz Club staff. Our daughter is very picky and for the first time, she begged to go back there. They have a great supervision and they let the kids do fun activities such as cooking classes and crafting. The food was really good (buffet offered a different choice everyday). The all-inclusive program is really worth the price. They have good brands when it comes to drinks and they have a cute little cafe where you can get ice cream, pastries and sandwiches between the meals. The beach was beautiful and the thing that amazed me the most was the staff's ability to offer alternative options that are better than what you wanted/expected. Now that we are back home, it felt like a little dream. Kudos to everyone involved in the success of this hotel. Definitely coming back in 2024.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

Their food espeically the fried whole fish at Isla Contoy, Sashimi at Torii, Pizza and Pasta at the italian restaurant, and authentic mexican cuisine at La Hoya were just AMAZING. We honestly thought about extending our stay because of food. They clean room almost 2-3 times  a day and make sure everything is shiny and spotless when we came back from outside activities.

10,4/9/2023,"The pool and beach at this hotel are gorgeous. Possibly one of the most beautiful beaches in Cancun. Free kayaks and paddle boards were a plus and loved by our family. The hotel itself is dated for sure and definitely requires renovations. Most of the decor appears to be tired and from the 80s, which is unfortunate since the outside of the hotel is so beautiful. Rooms are great with comfortable beds and the most amazing ocean views. The food was amazing from start to finish. Breakfast buffet was great and the Mexican restaurant had some of the best food we have ever had. All of the staff are wonderful and very attentive. Besides the decor, my only other complaint would be that this hotel lacks entertainment by the pool. I wish there was more for kids that was not at the kids club. We like to keep our kids with us and they enjoy activities by the pool, but this hotel lacked that. Otherwise we had a wonderful time.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
10,4/9/2023,"This is our first trip to Cancun as a family with a baby. GFACB hotel is one of the greatest hotels I've been in. Starting with the hospitality, restaurant, and rooms and kids club and play area, it was a fantastic experience. We experienced no problems during our entire visit.

Following that, I'd want to share my restaurant experience.We tried practically every all-inclusive restaurant, and each one took first place in terms of taste and food quality, particularly the Italian restaurant. The restaurant has a very authentic flavour, and the service was excellent. They treat their customers like kings and receive excellent treatment from all of the restaurants, particularly several of the waitresses like to mention(Elias from Italian, Carlos from Steakhouse, and the people who work in the omelette and smoothie station in the breakfast area).

Also, the poolside drink service and the hotel bar was awesome. They never exhibited any displeasure and they always served with a grin on their face. Also, the pool was really clean, including the walk area, which had 100± towels ready for you to grab.
The hotel is in a hot zone, so everything, including shopping and nightlife, is within a 5-minute walk.
Overall, Grand Fiesta is a good option if you want to spend your vacation without wasting money or time.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

Here, the food was outstanding. Me and my 3 other guest who are really into good food loved it. Even the room service food was great. I also loved how they served corona and modelo. If you sit at the beach you can get a server all day long. As long as you tip he will be right back every 20 minutes. I highly recommend going to all the resturants and using the omelette bar for breakfast. The king bed ocean room view is perfect. Comfortable and nice and cold. No issues in the room. Room service comes twice a day. This is by far the best resort I’ve been too in Cancun.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

The staff were all very friendly and professional, always greeted you with a smile. Bryan helped check us in and out during our stay, very professional, friendly and humorous. We really liked the food at the pool-side bar and at the restaurants, La Joya, Torii, and the Steakhouse. The Mariachi band in La Joya was fun to listen to while we had our dinner. My daughters loved it when they played Un Poco Loco, which they remembered from the movie ""Coco."" There was a fairly nice selection of breakfast items at the indoor breakfast buffet. The dining staff were all excellent. We were always seated quickly and served in a timely manner. The pools and beaches are also very clean with beautiful, relaxing, scenic views. We went snorkeling twice through the Coral Marine Beach company provided by the hotel, which was very fun. The captains, Orlando and Lorenzo, were very friendly and helpful. Orlando was patient and professional when teaching us how to snorkel and guiding us around the reef, pointing out where to look for fish, sea turtles, corals and underwater statues. Same with Nikki, our skipper who took beautiful pictures/videos for us. Lorenzo was very experienced, and quickly spotted a pair of dolphins.

10,23-08-2023,"This was the first time we brought our kids (8 & 14) to Cancun with us. We've stayed in many all inclusive adults only resorts but Grand Fiesta, being a family resort, didn't disappoint! Property and pools were amazing. Food, overall, was very good and breakfast buffet is second to none. The beach was a little smaller than we had imagined but the water was beautiful and the kids loved it. Nightly entertainment was decent with the exception noted below.

Our only true complaint was the 24K show where they recreate acts like Madonna, Bruce Springsteen, etc. One act had a man dressed as a woman and the next had a full on drag queen. We found this highly inappropriate for a ""family friendly"" show so we, along with many others, got up and left.

10,7/8/2023,"After reading reviews, we settled for this property. It did not disappoint. Amazing location, beautiful beach, good food, safe, and right by the ferry dock that goes to Cozumel and Isla Mujeres. That was very convenient! Will be back!",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
10,6/8/2023,"This was our third time in Cancun in the several years. Second time with kids though. I never forget my amazing experience at Secrets the Vine, I remember we didn’t need to book anything for any restaurant, you would just show! Only one restaurant at Secrets required reservation. What GF American Coral is doing very well is their attention to detail, courtesy and customer service is good, however you can run out of spot at a restaurant even 3 days out which is a bit frustrating. I know this is a family oriented resort but our biggest complaint would be the heated pools. Why heat pools in a place that is so hot and humid? It was pretty uncomfortable… it was too shallow everywhere. I am 6.2 and water is just above my waist in any of the 4 pools. 
I also think they are short staffed at the beach area. They have just one waiter serving a pretty big crowd so it takes quite some time to come across your waiter and to get your drink as well. They need to double or triple the crew at the beach, it was easier for me to walk to the bar at times. Also you have to wake up early to go get a spot with an umbrella at the beach or pool. I think they should have crew members offering shade at your arrival. Once again none of these things are a big deal and I would stay here again without a doubt. Rooms were sound proof and the view from the 9th floor was amazing. I definitely recommend this place.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

8,6/8/2023,"This was our second time at the resort. We returned to this resort because of the VIP access. Overall we had a wonderful time.
The staff and service was excellent. Our suite was beautiful with wonderful views of the ocean. Our room was clean and the room service was fast. The Concierge level was spectacular food and drinks, our check in was top notch. The decor throughout the resort is beautiful. Special shout out to the staff by the VIP section of the beach and pool area, the were attentive and kind. The shows were spectacular 

Some things to consider, the property is dated and is in need of repair throughout. Ceilings have water spots and water damage, in need of a paint job on the outside of resort. The food at the resort was not so good. We are foodies and the food throughout the resort was bland with no flavor. The only restaurant we enjoyed was the Mexican restaurant. Breakfast good at the buffet. The Tuscan restaurants food was not good but the service was great. The food throughout the resort needs seasoning. Also, there should have been a place where you could get chips, salsa and guacamole. Didn’t see this option at all, we had to go off property to get this.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
6,6/8/2023,"It’s a nice hotel, the view from the room is the best, private beach.

10,6/8/2023,"The resort was beautiful. My family and I stayed for 4 nights and 5 days. We really wished we stayed longer because we were completely relaxed just chilling in the pool and eating all the delicious food. We did wish we were able to book more restaurants but a lot of them were already full on the days we’re there and you can’t reserve the same day. Overall, we had a very enjoyable time and will definitely come back.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

4,4/8/2023,"The first room we got smell like cigarette, the second room we got had dirty shower water and then no water at all.

8,3/8/2023,"The room was very comfortable and the pool was beautiful. The food at the Mexican restaurant was very good and the atmosphere was nice.

10,1/8/2023,"we got an excellent experience with GFACB from its over all location (very safe, beach area was entirely private), staff interactions (very professional & accommodating:dnt 4gt tips) room conditions (very large and AC was blasting cold) dining options (we got reservations for dinner every night and was top notch), water activities (enjoyed the jetski and kayak) nightly entertainment (mexican fiesta, fire show, 24k magic, lobby band, late night adult party) the food (very delicious, none in our group have upset stomach or some sort, we are always full), the drinks (very good drinks from virgin drinks to alcohol choices, drinking water from glass was very safe), kids club (neutral), the pool (beautiful and large, a bit warm but its summer) and the beach (thankfully it cleared out compared to the 2 weeks prior of visit due to sargassum). we indeed have a blast and it seems the planets were all aligned with our vacation. All of our request was accommodated like having our 3 rooms next to each other (was even near to elevators, buffet area and exit towards pool) and changing dinner time to be able to attend the 9pm show and etc..  We are all glad choosing GFACB for our very first all inclusive Cancun vacation in which it raised the bar to high. The reviews stands and were never wrong with us based on our experience. we would really like to come back soon. we are a party of 10, 6 adults and 4 kids from DFW Texas area and our couple visitor from the Netherlands:  4 night 5 days stay",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
6,1/8/2023,The ocean view was nice. Staying in the hotel was the worst sleep i had in 5days. The beds are old abd uncomfortable. The rooms are dated. There is not enough activities for kids. The drinks are watered down.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

10,31-07-2023,"Amazing experience, Fiesta Americana Coral Beach Cancun has been the one of the best all inclusive resorts that I have ever been. All staff was very professional and  super friendly. The food was really good, the buffet had a lot of variety including Korean and Indian food. The seafood was great, especially the shrimps. My room was always clean and had a great ocean view. The beach was nice, even though there were not a lot of free beds with umbrellas, the hotel employees always helped me to find a bed and an umbrellla. I had the beach dinner experience, and iw was fabulous. I completely recommend that experience.  Great pool, plenty of space for adults and for kids. The kids club had personal trained for autistic kids which I think is great. In conclusion, i will definitely come back again.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
6,30-07-2023,"stay was overall ok, didn’t like communication with reception also the word GRAND is for the beach name which is grand coral resort has nothing to do with Grand. Restaurants are always full for the booking so we ended up eating at the common buffet for most of our stay. We booked two family and friends suits room. They ended up giving us 4 bedrooms.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
4,30-07-2023,"We paid more to stay in this hotel due to the kids pool area, amenities and reviews however once there, the gym was closed and in construction, kids pool area inactive (picture taken from the top of the hotel and the kids pool section is closed). The room had drainage issue in the bathtub and sink and took them 2 days to try to fix it without success. We kept requesting to change room without success and gave up to avoid further stress. Food was ok but not the best. The daily activity journal we only received on the last two days (we stayed 5 days) and on the date of the activity that makes you loose the morning free activity if you are interested. I would suggest to put the journal on the day before in the room when they set up the beds. The beach area is restricted and if you like to have a walk, choose another hotel. Overall unfortunately, I would not recommend the hotel that is pricey for what they offer.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

If you’re dining at the restaurants on site, be sure to make reservations upon arrival.  Pool was clean, and never overcrowded.  Private beach area was beautiful and had the most amazing views.  We were upgraded upon arrival and treated like family. There were nightly events and plenty of things for kids to do.

2,28-07-2023,I did not receive any benefit at this VIP property while my non member companion did. They are not accommodating when it comes to dining service. The food at the buffet felt like it was also used  in the individual restaurants. This hotel is more geared towards family oriented guest and should be in its heading. Location is great. Close to the ferry and market.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

8,26-07-2023,"A very nice resort with a very large pool area. The food is really good but not great. We did the two extra charge dining experiences and thought those meals were excellent. They do have a quality tequila selection and were happy to pour the good stuff (honestly I don't think they had a true bottom shelf option). All of the staff was very helpful and extremely friendly. We felt very safe here and would consider a return trip with our children.

I think they could have done better at communicating events, as we learned that there was an entertaining show one night that I would have liked to attend, but never saw an advertisement. We had steak one night and I think I was the only person to not return their meal due to the toughness (inability to cut or chew) of their steak. The beach was also very lacking as it appears that 1/2 of their beachfront has eroded (I'm sure its not their fault, but images online did not match real life).",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
6,26-07-2023,"One star for kids club, one star for the pool and one star for the view. Hotel is old, and the venting system in the room is too loud specially while sleeping. Food is just so so although seafood in general is fresh. Very slow service but it’s understandable that it’s just post-pandemic so they may still play catch-up. Some hotel staff just have the wrong attitude towards the customers, and arrogant in many ways. Poor communication too. Would recommend to consider other all-inclusive resorts for family with younger children.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

6,26-07-2023,"The resort was okay.  The check in was a nightmare and took 3 hours. Once we got into our room, the view was gorgeous but the  room had mirrors that had black spots all over it. The restaurants are nice but I had to create a fuss before I got actual reservations before 9pm  and when we did go to our reservations at 6:30/7 the restaurants were half empty so I don’t understand why they couldn’t give us the reservations to begin with. Selma and Antonio were amazing pool hosts but we had a hard time tracking down the activities and times of the activities. We had signed up for a paint class but when we got there it was already filled with others. So it was more like a first come first served. They also have a free ride to isla mujeres but no one tells you anything, there is no list of activities anywhere and the reservations at dinners are next to impossible to get unless you make a fuss. It seems like they are trying to do the minimum at this resort when every other resort in Cancun is really trying their best to ensure you have a good time- at fiesta Americana they just want to get you in the door and then do nothing else. Chantal, one of the waitresses at the pool was awesome. She was able to help us get lunch without me having to track her down, that was nice. Other employees seem to run away from you and avoid eye contact.  We’ve stayed at the fiesta Americana in puerta Vallarta and it was a million times better than this place. I wouldn’t go back to this resort.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
6,26-07-2023,Just kinda typical Mexico resort. Wristbands and they try and shove you into the buffet by making it very difficult to get reservations at the nice restaurants. We made our reservations the moment we arrived and never ate before 8pm.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

Slippers were made available for all guests and mini bar re-stocked as often as needed. Loved the room service option. Will definitely be coming back! Large pools throughout the front overlooking the ocean. Activities by the pool for everyone to enjoy. Only one suggestion, Pool could be cooler. But everything else great! Pool sizes are amazing even though there is a lot of people you don’t feel like sardines everyone has more than enough space.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
10,22-07-2023,"We stayed at Grand Fiesta Americana Coral Beach Cancún five days and loved it! It’s a well maintained, family friendly resort with several very good restaurants to choose from, a beautiful spa, several swimming pools, and an awesome staff. All employees were very attentive, friendly and accommodating. Our (two bed) room was large, included a sectional big enough for two adults to sleep there if needed, the fridge had free water, snacks, etc., the view was beautiful, and there were several chairs at the balcony to sit there, but we didn’t use the balcony since we were always doing something at the beach, relaxing at one of the pools or eating. 
There is only one gift shop and it’s a bit pricey. So, pack everything you’re going to need. 
Take $1 and $5 notes to tip employees. You’re not required to tip, but the staff is very friendly and provides excellent service.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

8,19-07-2023,Beautiful property with great potential.

10,18-07-2023,"Las instalaciones del hotel son muy agradables y en general están en buenas condiciones (se nota el mantenimiento) y todo el personal en recepción, restaurantes, camareras, room service, gimnasio, playa fue muy amable y siempre dispuesto a atender con eficiencia y una sonrisa. La comida es buena y variada, sin ser excepcional. La limpieza en la habitación fue mucho mejor que la vez anterior que estuvimos allí. Lamentablemente la playa no está en buenas condiciones porque el mar se la ha ""comido"", y ahora hay muchas piedras, costales y raices de palmeras que impiden caminar por ella; dentro del agua, en la orilla, hay que tener cuidado con las piedras (inclusive me raspé una rodilla con una de ellas). Es cierto que no es culpa del hotel, pero es una lástima porque además de tener oleaje tranquilo se podía hacer una buena caminata. Otros comentarios: 1) le falta más animación al hotel; si se desea un lugar muy tranquilo para descansar, relajarse y desconectarse de todo éste es un lugar perfecto, pero más allá de relajarse en las albercas y la playa no hay realmente otras cosas que hacer durante el día, y en la noche únicamente hay algún músico en el bar del lobby. 2) El restaurante donde está el buffet es inadecuado para personas con problemas de movilidad porque tiene muchos escalones; además, para servirse la comida hay que bajar una escalera. 3) Se sugiere que en temporada alta habiliten más lugares para el desayuno y evitar la larga fila.
El hotel nos gusta y regresaremos.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
10,17-07-2023,"Beautiful location overlooking the Caribbean Sea. Close proximity to Hotel Zona, La Isla Mall, and excursions easily managed through the hotel. The staff was amazing and went above and beyond to cater to our needs especially as some of us are vegetarians. The breakfast buffet was extensive; we loved the fresh detox smoothie and made to order omelets. Kids club is great and my daughter loved it! 
We spent 6 nights and no complaints except that the main gym is under renovations so limited setup within the spa.

I've stayed at other resorts in Cancun that were all-inclusive (including a 5-star resort) and this had better food and beverage. The rooms are very clean but are aging with looks and modernness. The beach is on the smaller side, has small waves good for swimming, and is well-maintained. Unfortunately, Cancun is experiencing a major seaweed problem now (not the resort's fault of course), which makes the water discolored from crystal clear aqua blue, to dark brown. The pool is gigantic, clean, and a very nice way to spend your day. The staff is very helpful and nice. The location is perfect. You are just steps away from the strip where a lot of the clubs, bars, and restaurants are located. I would come back here again.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

Couple of things I learned:
1) To reserve a beach bed in your desired location, you need to act early and it is not enough to put your beach towels on it. You’ll need to put a personal item as well.
2) Reserve hotel restaurants as soon as possible. Same day or the night before reservations may not be available.

-Great food!!!! 
-Service was good from most employees. 
- Great restaurants.

Cons: 

-We have toddlers and barely got to use the baby water park from 10-11am and then got kicked out as older kids were going to begin activities. It would be good to have a longer space for younger kids. Say 8-11am.
-There are not enough servers on the restaurants specially Viña del Mar, hence often times we did not got drinks or even had to stand up and get them ourselves.
-Too much loud music everywhere. There are no spaces to enjoy the ocean sound...or even peaceful times. It is all laud music everywhere.
- Your travel agents from coral beach desk sold us a premier plan to Isla Mujeres worth around 500 dollars a day for two adults and two toddlers. The catamaran was excellent but, when we got to the island the food was terrible and we had no umbrellas or beach club as promised; only for 1 hour (which was the time we spend eating). So we had to pay even more when we were there also my kids got sunburned. We felt abused.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
6,1/7/2023,"Comida en el buffet fría muy poca variedad, falta de atención del personal a huéspedes, falta de variedad de alimentos en área de alberca , falta de entretenimiento dentro del hotel y en la área de la alberca definitivamente no vuelvo muy bonito por dentro pero el peor resort donde me e quedado en Cancún y costoso para lo que ofrecen a huéspedes",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

8,26-06-2023,"We just got back and our family of 4 with two kids, 12 and 13, had a blast.  Met some very nice people there, the staff and food was great, and beach access was perfect.  We felt safe and cared for.  Great vacation.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
8,26-06-2023,"This is a great resort for families.  The pool areas (connected) and are large.  I believe there were 3 swim up bars.  The beach area was limited, but had ample lounge chairs toward one end.  The buffet food was limited availability at times, but highly recommend trying the restaurants - we were very pleased with our dinner meals.

For kids: In addition to swimming, the gaming lounge (opened at 3:00p.m.) was a favorite and they loved access to soft serve anytime. 

I would say there were 2 things that were a little lacking: (1) due to the high amount of humidity some rooms tend to smell musty.  Not true of all rooms, as we had a large group and some had no issues.  The staff did their best to minimize the odor and even changed out the room filters, etc.  I would just recommend that if you receive a room that smells this way, to immediately ask for an alternate room before unpacking.  The hotel staff was very accommodating.  I want to emphasize the rooms were spotless and it really just due to high humidity.
(2) Communication about events and activities.  There was no apparent schedule for the week to be aware of events and activities.  I can understand why it may not be efficient to print schedules, but a daily event board in the lobby, would be awesome.

Overall, we had a fun time.  Our group was a party of 24 with 9 kids ages 2 - 18 and adults up to age 92.  I would recommend this resort for families.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
10,26-06-2023,The place was perfect.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
10,25-06-2023,"Expedia. When checking in I was expecting the resort will explain and share details about the amenities but they didn’t. It was just because I did some research about the hotel prior to  our arrival that we kind of knew what they have and managed around. We understand it is a big resort but not being able to make reservations in sone restaurants and for dinners and the Fiesta Americana prior to our arrival  left us with no reservations.
Love the pool and how clean the whole resort is.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

10,23-06-2023,"My husband and I had an amazing time at the Grand Fiesta Americana for our honeymoon. Neither of us have ever done an all-inclusive resort before, and we weren't totally sure what to expect from the experience.

However, we could not have felt more welcome from the second that we stepped through the doors. At check-in, we received a free upgrade from the ocean-view queen that we booked to an ocean-view master suite. Our room was GORGEOUS. The pools were the perfect temperature, especially during the 90 degree days. We weren't expecting much from resort food, but it was all pretty decent. The drinks were good. The service was outstanding. Every person who helped us, even when we were totally clueless tourists, was warm, kind, and patient. 

If we have anything to complain about it would be that we could hear pretty loud club music in our room until about 10:30 most nights. Which, I know, we're on vacation, and we should be chill with that. However, we were so exhausted from various tours every day that it did hinder our sleep a bit at first. We also wished that there were more dinner options without having to make a reservation the previous day - that was a bit of a headache.

Overall though, we had an absolutely fabulous time.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

Cons: you have to make a reservation to eat and they fill up fast.  I arrived on Wednesday at 5pm and could not get a reservation until Friday. They also allow kids, this was not so bad but be aware of this. Cab  fair was a bit expensive and ubers and lifts were not an option. The drinks were a bit weak just get double shots",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

Now for the can use improvements . All but one place to eat was great The seafood restaurant by the beach was HORRIBLE didn’t taste fresh the sushi was not good at all and what was supposed to be hot was cold. The place at the pool where they do the grill was not accommodated first he didn’t understood when I was telling him I don’t eat meat and asked for a vegan burger another server came and I got a vegetarian burger which was horrible. If you are young and need entertainment this is not the place for you pretty-much you have only fire show  Mexican party and singing in the lobby so bedtime for you is early Lol  Other than that ..the place was great and I will be back next year .I enjoyed celebrating my birthday BEAUTIFUL CLEAN FRIENDLY SAFE",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

6,15-06-2023,"I have been to this property numerous times since 2020. Each time I have seen a decline in service and food quality. The property is also in major need to upkeep. Toilet seat was loose, doors were not painted and staff were inconsistent and service was pretty poor. Took a minute to get a drink at bars and the level of service is not what I would expect or have encountered in the past. 

The pools are excellent and large enough that you will have plenty of space. I would say this is the best feature. Our children did enjoy the kids club and they did a great job. All in all, the property is nice, but compared to the price we have paid to stay at other resorts, I have received the same if not better service and food quality at lower rated resorts and will likely not return to Grand Fiesta unless they significantly step their service and food game up.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

Pools were clean and large. My only gripe would be the bathrooms are a bit dingy and dated. Even a simple recaulk and faucet replacement would go a long way as you see rust and staining. Don’t get me wrong, it’s as clean as possible by the cleaning staff, the materials are just worn. Also humid rooms compared to other places I’ve stayed in - maybe needs better circulation? None of these would deter me from returning however. Overall great place to stay.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

10,5/6/2023,"Excellent and Amazing Experience. We travelled with 2 kids and we had the best experience ever with this Resort.  The Kids Club is the best, the staffs are very friendly and hospitality is amazing. The services are top class and five star.  Below are some of my experiences: 

Pros: 
1. Kids Club is amazing and the kids love the teachers and amenities/activities. 
2. The food is great and if you read a bad review on food, please have them talk to me lol.
3. The restaurants in the resort are high end and superb with five star food. 
4. The drinks and cocktails are great. 
5. The hotel provides free boat ride tickets to Isla Muheres island, which you should not miss. 
6. The Shows are top of the line shows- magic show, 24K show, aquatic shows, fire show. These are the best shows we ever seen. 
7. The walk to the local town was safe enough. 
8. The beaches are super clean and well managed. 
9. Check-in and checkout was not a hassle. 
10. The room service was the best ( 25-30 minutes). 
11. Can order food from the beach and served quickly whenever and wherever.

Cons: 
1. The restaurants on premises require Dinner reservations in advance. Walk-ins are welcome too but the wait is long. 
2. The pool walk in bar closes at 5:30 every evening. Have to walk out of the pool and walk to different bar to get drinks.
3. The food order at the pool bar closes at 6 every evening.

10,3/6/2023,"This is a beautiful property with amazing things to do day and night. The facilities are kept meticulously. Yes, this is an older hotel with an older aesthetic, but if you see beyond that, their staff are amazing!!!

We were 3 kids and 4 adults. We had lots of choices for eating. The buffet changes daily! We also enjoyed a lot of the poolside food and drinks (took a little long, but good). Hats off to Chantal and Fernando for their excellent service. 

The kids enjoyed the Kids club and many engaging games with them. There’s also poolside entertainment and evening hotel entertainment. We did not need to leave the premise. The beaches are well-maintained and it’s so appealing to take a dip. We didn’t have to worry about the sargassum. People respect the “towel reservations” on the beach loungers, and personnel are happy to assist and accommodate all guests.

The rooms were large and had a step-down sitting area and balcony. They all point to the ocean. The turn-down service with slippers, pillow arrangements, waters and mints were not something I expected to love, but I did.
I cannot speak high enough about this place. 

The only bad part was the travel center that is in all of the hotels in Cancun and that functions as Mexico Travel Solutions. They’re predatory. Inconsistent prices and constantly make you pay more money for an already paid service. It does not speak well of GFACB to be associated with them.Avoid!

Looking forward to a future trip to the GFACB.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

The infinite club and perks were awesome , my guy Carlos at the sundeck was awesome. Restaurants were great, Le Basilia was amazing please do it, we met a higher up.in the elevator who was great an informed us there are 3 new restaurants coming an Italian dining experience with live music(opera,classical), a asian with live cooking tables, and a n steakhouse, So this place is a new go to, come enjoy the Grand Fiesta Americana Coral Beach, you wont regret it.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

The service was amazing from the maintenance of the property (our room was cleaned twice a day and we always had fresh towels, robes, and even hotel slippers). Food met beyond our expectations from 24 hr room service to the a lactarte restaurants and buffet which made our stay a lot more seamless travelling with a 10 month old and toddler. All rooms are beach front with breathtaking views, comfortable beddings, and very spacious rooms. The beach was crystal blue with white sand. The hotel provided enough umbrellas and beach chairs at no extra cost. The resort provided a more relaxed and family feel however, it is in the centre of restaurants, night clubs, and market.

8,28-05-2023,"Arriving and checking in was great, once you walk-in seems so peaceful and clean.  Breakfast was loved by my daughters they loved their chilaquiles I loved my omelettes!  Orange juice was delicious tastes fresh everyday!  I disliked that they state some restaurants like the Italian no need for reservation, my daughters and I get there since they were craving it since we got there and reservation was needed…. Finally did reservations for the Mexican restaurant and Tuscany.  Mexican restaurant was great, delicious and a nice mariachi !  Waiter got the mariachi to sing Las mañanitas and he did this really nice show with fire to end the night!  Two thumbs up!!  Tuscany on the other hand lacked flavor and service not to mention over an hour to get our food.  My daughter started feeling sick after tasting their salad.  She wanted to vomit went to the restroom after it.  As she returned she tried eating their food but it wasn’t what we expected.  As mentioned service was not so good maybe since the day before the Mexican restaurant was just great and were expecting the same.  Their pizza was good but the rest was just not so great.  Earlier that day I also thought it was weird that one of their entrance employees trough his headset told someone that an Arab person and 2 ladies were waking down the Hotel… I don’t know just thought it was weird and made me uncomfortable after that….  Overall the pool was great the food was good, the beach was nice and great service at their breakfast",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

Everything was spotless
Service was friendly, impeccable and fast..
The room was clean top to bottom and included turn down service..
The pool and beach was cleaned,swept and  raked of sand and seweed every morning...

Food was good...nice choice of restaurants..mexican was wow..otherwise it is what you would expect from an all inclusive..
Not perfect but tasty
The cerveche station and bbq guy by pool were the best..as was buffet breakfast..
Room service was quick and elegantly served.. 

I believe my only criticism would be to have a bathroom vent installed... with the bathroom being in the back of the room it could use it..

Ohh almost forgot..
The gem spa is Fantastic!!!
The 1hr massage came with a 2hr hydro therapy session (steam sauna cold pool etc)...
It was impressive and is a must if you stay here ..

I'd go back in a second to this hotel!!!!

I suggest the Isla Contoy   All of the pools were extremely clean. The beach was absolutely perfect.  The shows they offered were fun.  The rooms were very nice and extremely clean.

I will never stay any place else other than this property.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

4,11/5/2023,I have traveled to Cancun about 15 times in the last 9 years. I have stayed at resorts ranging from non-AI to all-inclusive. Coral Beach was a bit disappointing. The lobby was dark and the restaurants were dark as well. The views from the room were great. I saw many patrons sitting around the lobby on their phone. No nightly entertainment. Kid's club was not interactive.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

Location was perfect for us as well.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
10,8/5/2023,"Large property with gorgeous pools, flowers and restaurants. I went to the gym and the Spa. The Spa was accommodating and relaxing with many services.  I would Have enjoyed there being more boutiques or shopping on the premises, but other than that it had numerous things available.   Our room was large and comfortable with a wide open balcony view of the ocean. 
    We would stay here again, however, it is a family atmosphere and lots of very young children were there, so if you’re looking for a quieter couples resort, this would not be for you. The staff were all friendly and welcoming.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

Cannot wait to go back!",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
4,26-04-2023,"RUN from this resort!! What a scam. The property itself is very nice and the beach was fine, but a huge ripoff. Paid almost $3k for 2.5 days. Room size was nice, but unnecessary. Was supposed to come with a bottle of wine, but never delivered. Our group paid $1k extra for a private birthday dinner on the beach. They made up lies and sat us 10 steps away in the same restaurant we ate at the night before and refused to refund our money. EXACT same food as the night before. We had some cheap Dollar Store balloons that were put up. And a cake, but its all inclusive and the same deserts were everywhere. The only good food was breakfast. Lunch was ehh. And dinner was awful all 3 nights. Barely ate anything but bread after breakfast. The drinks were acceptable, but nothing amazing like we've had at other resorts. There are much better choices in Cancun.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

They were friendly and at the same time super professional. The feeling that someone loves serving you a breakfast with kindness and love it was so special. Alex and Rene at the beach and the pool were beyond fun and helpful. Miguel and Gerardo at the door would make you feel welcome to your home. I cant remember all the names but I can tell thank you all for an amazing experience, we would definitely come back soon.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

8,23-04-2023,"The property overall was kept very clean and was beautiful.  The amenities were plentiful. The room service was okay / good. The La Joya restaurant was amazing. My complaints are the bed wasn’t the most comfortable. Also, rather than concierge handling everything for you there was a separate concierge for everything. Transportation, activities, pool rentals, etc. So, you had to chase down different people which was a hassle. I wish the resort would have sent me an email prior to arrival with all of this information so that dinner, events, transportation and rentals could have been booked in advance. They require booking dinner reservations a day in advance so when I arrived in my bday I couldn’t have dinner anywhere. They require transportation reservations 2 days prior. Which I had no idea about so that was an issue. Send people your requirements so we know what to do. We have never been to your resort before so how should we know?!  That was the most frustrating part. But we still had a nice, relaxing time.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

8,11/4/2023,"The VIP upgrade was a complete waste of money as it provided nothing more than the regular service.  And was useless compared to other hotels who offer that service 

Food was hit or miss which for a 4/5 star shouldn’t be the case.  And the chair situation was chaotic in that people started reserving at 5:30 AM daily.  

There were some high points including some of the festivities, the pool was amazing but they seemed very understaffed and the reservation situation at dinner made it tough to plan.  You would think all that money for VIP would help with services but it did not.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
10,11/4/2023,"I was absolutely impressed on every level. I couldn’t have enjoyed my stay more. The hotel is gorgeous, the food is great, it’s such a comfortable hotel on every level if you’re with kids.

10,9/4/2023,"Low points:
1. My reservation changed from 3 people to 2 people four weeks before my stay, and hotel and Expedia were unwilling/unable to provide a refund. So I paid $1100 for a person who did not come.
2. My son and his friend were surrounded by five police officers and robbed of $400 (forced to go to an ATM) right outside the hotel.
3. The hotel communicates poorly about dinner reservations. We called before and we were told reservations are made when we arrive. But when we arrive, there were no reservations for the first two nights. The buffet is terrific, but had we known, we would have been less disappointed.
4. There is room service and everything is available, but there aren't really menus or a lot of information about how to order, what to order, how to get a spa appointment, etc. You have to ask the desk for everything.

High points:
1. Food and service is superb. Different food every day. Top liquors.
2. Shows every night.
3. Live music every day ( but lowest common denominator American pop songs -- if you love Guns and Roses and Bruno Mars, you're in the money)
4. Lots of pools.
5. The gym is nice.
6. Rooms are great.
7. Balconies are great.
8. Everything is very clean.
9. There are tons of staff and they are all friendly and helpful.
10. There is a plastic floating island which is awesome.
11. Kayaks and paddle boards are provided and awesome.

Neutral observations:
1. It's a very kid-friendly place, and there are tons of small children.
2. It's super sanitized.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
10,9/4/2023,This was our 4th time to the area. It was a very clean hotel with really excellent service. I would definitely say this is a family friendly hotel and if you are looking to have a party get away or quiet romantic weekend I would suggest looking elsewhere. It was very romantic for my husband and I however it was Spring break and there were tons of children everywhere,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
4,9/4/2023,"I have been in Cancun and Mexico several times and over ten different all-inclusive hotels before. This hotel is a good hotel but definitely it’s not five stars hotel. I don’t know those all positive reviews but they all mislead us to think this is a 5 stars luxury hotel. 
Very limited food option and other facilities and hotel activities. Very dated rooms. 
Overall I wouldn’t go back and I don’t recommend this hotel if you are looking for luxury five stars all inclusive hotel. If you are just looking for 3.5 or maybe 4 stars hotel it can be an option although I have been better 4 stars hotel than this one.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

6,3/4/2023,"Probably the best thing about this property is it’s location right on the beach and literally every room has an ocean view. There is very little walking out the door to the pool and beach.  The staff was exceptional.

Average with regards to the rooms themselves and hotel grounds.  A bit dated and rooms in need of some basic upgrades.  The mirrors, for instance, had some type of permanent tarnish/ corrosion spots and areas and the walls/ doors are in need of paint.

Two things were bad in my opinion.  The first is the fitness center.  Do very strict that no one under the age of 18 is allowed in even with adult accompaniment. My daughter is 14 and runs cross country and was looking forward to working out there every day. They would not let her in even with me, which I found completely absurd. Every fitness center I’ve been to in the United States allows that age in.  The other is the dining situation. The day we arrived, we tried to make all of our dining reservations for the week. However, there were literally no openings in any of the a la carte restaurants for the entire week.  They will not make reservations before you arrive, so how are you ever supposed to get into those restaurants? I do not know and they could not tell me. Anyway, the Buffay restaurant did have very good food.

Overall, this place was average, really made by its location and the staff. It could be a 5 Star Pl. if they would update it and fix the dining issues.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

10,30-03-2023,"Our 5 night stay was excellent. The hotel is well staffed and you feel taken care of at all times. There are staff doing service for drinks and food at the pool, giving you warm towels as you enter the hotel after your swim, and to place a napkin on your lap every time you sit for dinner. Staff are constantly cleaning - scrubbing the pool chairs and tiles every morning, clear long tables at dinner and there is not a piece of garbage on property. The rooms are clean, spacious and comfortable for sleeping and relaxing in the air conditioning. Lots of space to store items, a mini fridge that is stocked, and a safe. The pools are warm (78-80*) and have plenty of seating with swim up bars where the staff happily serve your child as many strawberry non-alcoholic daiquiris as they can hold in their bellies. The beach - OMG! So large, no seaweed, and beautiful white sand leading to crystal clear water. The view from our room on the 10th floor was amazing and allowed us to watch the nightly entertainment if it was in the beach or in the pool. There’s an arcade room that was well kept up and had plenty of video and tabletop games for families to play. The food was great at every restaurant. You always have access to the buffet which had many hot and cold options, clean and had a different theme of food each meal. We loved Tuscany the Italian spot and we paid up to eat at the Mediterranean restaurant that featured a set menu for adults. We LOVED all.

,26-03-2023,"My wife, 7 year-old daughter, and I stayed here over Spring Break 2023 (3rd week of March).  

Food: some of the best I've ever eaten. The main buffet had a different specialty each night, including steak and seafood.  My daughter had no problem finding something kid-friendly.

Pools: there are 4 semi-connected pools and were heated. We spent most of our time there, with the one on the west-end working the best for us, since it had a little cove my daughter played in, which was also near one of the swim-up bars. It never felt crowded.  Although I threw down towels around 7am to get our desired seating.  Some douche bags moved them on our final day (their first), but it worked out fine. We just moved back a row.

Pool service: this was great! Literally had someone coming by about every 15 minutes for drinks or food.  The food was really good and service was no longer than your average wait.

Rooms: we were on the 4th floor in the west end.  The air conditioning was nice and cool (you can control it in the room).  The beds were a little firm than we're used to, and is probably my only ""complaint"" of our trip.

Beach: this (and the food) is what really sets this place apart from others.  Very calm and swimmable, whereas most resorts in Cancun can face rough waves.  Gentle waves even on windier days...truly exceptional!",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

,21-03-2023,"We came here for the last part of our holiday and were disapppointed. Firstly there was a 20 min queue to check in.
Then when we finally got our ocean view room - there was no view! There was two huge trees - behind of which was apparently the ocean not that you could see at all! Photo below! 
After arguing that it was unacceptable they moved us to a room which stunk of cigarettes and which clearly  hadn’t been used for a while (after telling us there was no other rooms available). The view was excellent here.
Overall I would say this hotel is worth it for those looking for all inclusive food - that looked very good. The drinks they clearly cheap out on (eg orange juice is made from a syrup) and the service is very in the box - eg they can serve how they know but any other requests/out of the norm eg fruit any time but breakfast is a problem.

6,17-03-2023,"Good: 
The staff and service were great. They were very courteous and helpful. 
There were multiple pools, each with their own bars. There were more fun pools with games and also quieter pools for relaxing. The daily grill option at the pool was also a very nice touch. Every day there was something else being cooked fresh to order, sometimes on charcoal fire. Tacos, hot dogs, burgers, etc.
The Monday Mexican party was also great. It was probably our dining highlight our stay.
The resort is very child friendly and there were a lot of kids. All restaurants we ate at had high chairs and kid's options for food. They have a kids zone as well that we didn't use (kids were too young) but it is something that's available.

The bad:
This was one of the more expensive All Inclusive options in the area and probably not worth the extra cost. The rooms are old and the food is mostly just alright. Overall, I had much higher expectations based on the price of the resort.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

10,10/3/2023,"Very very picky person with cleanness,food,beach,views. All of these is excellent.. only place I didn’t like is Italian restaurant, breakfast in the morning is not disappointing at all, by the beach pool areas you have person making gyros and tacos, also at the cabanas by the pool area you can order food from the kitchen, for fit guy person that working out you have a gym that is not that bad to get your workouts at, there’s no protein so you will have to eat to replace the protein shakes there’s no protein bars. Jet ski are so fun $65 for half hour you will have a blast. First thing when you get there is you book every day dinner with front staff at the desk.. so if you are a big eater and want to eat later at the night save Somme food from the evening at night you cannot order food. There’s a super market bigger than Walmart across the street. You can get anything you want from there. For washing clothes they charge  $70 for one shirt that is ridiculous expensive. Hanging clothes on the balcony. Is not allowed unless you do it at night they watch you like hungry eagle be careful right there. Other than that everything is on point. They also charge resort daily fee for 5 days is like $23 not to bad.( the restaurants are all good except the Italian avoid that one)",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

10,9/3/2023,"My husband and I spent 4 nights here to celebrate my birthday. It was a wonderful trip! We went to the spa (great massage!), went snorkeling (not too many fish, but lots of fun), took a tequila-tasting and margarita-making class poolside (tasty!), enjoyed room-service, pool-service, and lots of food and drinks. The staff could not be more accommodating. There was always someone around to offer you assistance. Everything was clean, even the bathrooms by the pool. We ate at the French restaurant and it was well worth the $100 surcharge. All of the food we had at the resort was delicious, especially the dinners at La Hoya and the Italian restaurant.

The room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. The view of the Caribbean Sea, with Isla Mujeres was breathtaking. We did the all-inclusive and thought the food was pretty good! The buffet had many options, the views and ceviche at the Isla Conroy was excellent, and the ambience and food at La Joya was great.

The staff were friendly and helpful as well.

Highly recommend, we would definitely return!",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

10,23-02-2023,"The staff were all very pleasant, hotel is clean and safe. The only thing that you may want to consider is asking for a room away from the terrace if you have kids that sleep early. They had a few events with very loud music that started at 7pm and went until 10 and my child’s bedtime is 7pm. There is also not much to do for younger kids that can’t go to the kids club. I did use their paid nanny service, TOTALLY worth it Yolanda and Karina were awesome with my 17 month old.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
4,23-02-2023,The Hotel property was spectacular.   The shuttle service that expedia provided was not.  I spent over $100 in transportation to and from airport and Expedia only reimbursed me $51.21.  Not to mention how frightening it was to taxi from airport to hotel.  I've heard never get in a taxi in Mexico.  You hear bad things.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

4,20-02-2023,"This place is ok but the quality of management remains highly questionable. 

Unfortunately, my wife had a fall-slip accident on her way to the restroom near the pool area on 2nd day of our stay.
My wife hit her head and face down to the floor. Her front teeth were broken.
We brought her to the onsite doctor in the resort. The doctor seemed not too sure how she would need to respond in an emergency like ours.  I asked the doctor if it would be possible for my wife to get further medical treatments like X-rays on her head and left arm, besides checking her blood pressure. ( because that was pretty much the only thing the doctor checked at first)  The doctor said that we call a taxi and go to the nearby hospital.  That was a point where I got really confused and upset.  My wife HIT HER HEAD TO THE SOLID CONCRETE FLOOR, HER FRONT TEETH WERE BROKEN. It was obvious that my wife was suffering concussion and in a lot of pain. 
If you are a doctor, you should know better than telling a patient who suffers concussion to walk and get a taxi. 

Thus, I asked for a resort manager. He showed up and asked me a funny question. 
He asked "" what is that you want me to do Sir?
Well... HOW ABOUT CALLING FOR AN AMBULANCE so my wife could get the medical treatments asap without telling us to get a taxi and go. That was when they finally called for an ambulance. But this bizarre story does not end there.  Too bad expedia does not allow me to write any more than 1500 words.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
8,20-02-2023,"The location, beach, pools and staff were amazing! We very much enjoyed the violinist playing by the pool! The buffet food was standard all-inclusive food and the specialty restaurants were average with exception of the Italian place, it was excellent! We did not try the French restaurant as we did not want to pay the up-charge. The rooms were very nice but definitely needed some TLC. The mirror has spots missing the reflective glass and the bathtub edge has been obviously repaired many times. But everything worked well, it was clean and we always had hot water.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

8,3/2/2023,"We visited in October of 2021 and had a great time. We got a room upgrade to a suite that we really enjoyed. This time around we paid more money and got a lot less for it. Our ""upgrade"" was barely worth it and for the price we paid you can get a lot better deals in Cancun.

The room was so-so. Half the ocean front view was taken up by an adjacent building (we were in the corner). The air conditioner was either full blast or off with no way to regulate it. When it rained the window leaked and the staff put towels on the floor to contain it.

Overall the resort is pretty nice and in a great location. The staff is very helpful albeit somewhat disorganized. The food is great for an all inclusive, but the drinks much less so. You have to ask for brand names or you end up with diluted drinks.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

Not much has changed, the food is still good, the hotel is beautiful, and the staff is stIll EXCEPTIONAL! The beach is the best in Cancun as it sits on top of the 7 where the ocean us calm. They’ve also upped their game with nightly entertainment which is a huge plus. I wasn’t a fan of the bracelet we had to wear all week, wish they could figure out a better system. Its annoying to sunbathe with it on. My only other gripe is in regards to tipping. All week, I watched other guests dine & drink, and never leave a tip. All inclusive does NOT mean that you don’t have to leave a tip! The staff goes above & beyond and they work so hard. I blame this partly on the hotel because its impossible to get change. We asked the front desk twice to change out our $100’s for smaller bills, and they said that they don’t do that. They wouldn’t even give us pesos. How do you expect guests to tip the staff? If you stay here, please bring lots of $1’s and $5’s as there is no other way to tip your amazing staff.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

2,2/1/2023,"This property is actually quite pretty and the food was great, but we had an awful experience where another guest was able to get into our room late at night and they were sure that they were in there room. They woke us up and did not understand why we were in their room. Thank goodness my husband was there because being a female awoken in the middle of the night by a random drunken man was unbelievable frightening. Later we figured out he thought he was in the room directly above us. He was just really drunk but now I can only imagine how easy it could be for any other person to get into a room. 

The hotel then had to rebook our shuttle for the airport. They rebooked for the wrong time. 1 hour early which was 2am. When they called our room we were not awake and they told us  they would not hold a cab for us unless we had proof that we booked through them. Thank goodness I actually took a picture of the shuttle request. They did find us a shuttle and compensate for us. 

When I let the property know about all the issues all they said is they would upgrade us next time we went. I’m sorry who would every go back to a property where random people can get into their rooms?!?!?!",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

6,8/11/2022,"I would give it a general OK.  As soon as we checked in we were whisked away by the rewards Live Aqua folks to try to get us to sign up for their fiesta americana program.  I kepts saying no thank you but every morning for the first three days he would come grab us the moment we stepped off the elevators trying to persuade us with free massages and such.  We traveled with a small child and did not want to buy into whatever he was selling.  They stopped trying the last two days of our vacation.  Food was nice but we had reservations to Tuscany and they handed us a drink menu and said none of them were included in the price.  They also handed us a QC code for the menu and we did not have phones as we dressed up for a nice night out.  We also had our 3yr old and i could have sworn they said no extra charges at this location...we felt terribly out of place.  We ended up leaving and going to the buffet across the hall instead.  Pool was nice, room was a bit cool and moiste.  There was a wild cat sleeping on the beach chairs so that was entertaining.  We were hoping to go to kids club with our 3yr old so he could play but they wouldnt let us in.  We didnt want to leave him there as he is not potty trained but wete hoping he could paint and play with us supervising but they said no.  Not a great place for people with toddlers.  The beach was lovely so maybe we will return someday when our child is older.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
10,6/11/2022,"From the moment we got there, this place was top notch. Staff is super friendly and always there to help you enjoy your stay. The food and drinks in the all inclusive was outstanding.

10,5/11/2022,"I gave this property an overall ""Excellent"" rating.  Most of the staff really goes out of their way to make it an awesome experience.  But, here's a couple of areas for suggested improvement.  First, the wristband policy is somewhat stringent.  On our last night my son's wristband came undone when we were dining inside the resort and he set it on the table.  It went missing and would've cost $100 dollars to replace, so we opted not to have it replaced since it was our last night.  He went out that night with his 2 brothers and when they came back at 2am he was initially not allowed to re-enter the premises(took a lot of persuading).   Second,  hotel staff quoted us a taxi price back to airport that was comparable to Smile & Go (little over $30),  The price was that we were actually charged was twice that, around $60 dollars.   That being said, I would still book again but with more caution.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
10,1/11/2022,My family had a great time! The beach and pools were great. The kids like the kids club. The most important was the customer service was great. We had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Gurrola and he really cares about the resort and is trying make sure everyone has an amazing experience. We also loved the Italian restaurant especially Violonist Carlos. He played very nicely and we went almost every night  to hear him play. This was one of the nicest resorts we’ve ever been at.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
10,31-10-2022,"Loved it !! We visited during the UK October half term 2 adults 2 kids. Weather was HOT HOT HOT. It showed at 31 but felt like 50!! Pools were clean, hotel was spotless, staff are very friendly and welcoming. Easy Beach access, tidy and staff on hand. Breakfast and Food selection is so yummy and full of variety. We attended a Mexico theme night on a Friday, amazing but must book in advance. My daughter has Coeliac Disease , the F&B team was very supportive and made a number of options for her. We booked a tour at the hotel, staff explained all was very reassuring and the day was a success!! Spa was slightly pricey, treatment was good. We booked a private transfer separately with Expedia so didn't use the hotel one.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

8,25-10-2022,"Overall: The experience was very relaxing and a nice, adult getaway for me and my husband. The resort was very nice, clean, and the staff was friendly. 
Food/Dining: The food was pretty good, but the reservations required and certain restaurants closing at different days/times was frustrating at times. 
Entertainment: The entertainment/shows scheduled around the resort were less than impressive because it was a guessing game on whether it happened or not. However, the resort is located right next to Cancun's party central, so if you really wanted to go out for entertainment you could. It just wouldn't be included in your stay. 
Amenities: The pool was a huge factor in our deciding to choose this resort over others. However, when we got there, more than half of it was being renovated. Luckily it was a slow time, so the pools they did have were enough for the guests. A notice on the website would have been appreciated as to major construction at the resort. 
Other: The last nagging disappointment was the inability to charge things to the room for the extras on the resort. For example, the little shop/store in the lobby and the water sports section outside required payment separate from the resort. This is a convenience other all-inclusive resorts I have been to have. I don't walk around with my wallet when I'm at an all-inclusive. I prefer to not deal with it as part of the all-inclusive convenience. I would have spent more around the resort had it not been for this restriction",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

Different options when it comes to food, round the o’clock room service and the view was killer. Everyone was hospitable and welcoming. They have daily activities and they have an Expedia office inside the resort so you can talk to a person one on one and workout a plan directly that can fit your calendar because they can provide more detailed information regarding timing,  excursions types and what to expect. All and All I was a happy guest. I have zero complaints. If I ever go to Cancun again I’ll definitely stay there without a question.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

Funny thing is we didn’t even leave the resort, except for one day to go to Isla Mujeras which was very easy, because the whole place was so nice and filled with activities.

10,11/10/2022,"We were visiting Cancun for a 25 year reunion of my husbands engineering friends.
The property was well maintained. Decorated with fresh flower arrangements and green foliage. 
The staff was courteous. I came across a guy named Jahdiel who introduced us to Motulenos', fresh Dragon Fruit and customized smoothies. 
After 3 days of eating the Mexican food my heart & soul was yearning for some Indian food. We came across Chef Basant Kumar. He had prepared a feast for us. Elaborate dinner included Paneer Pakoras (Cheese fries in a batter of gram flour), Chilli Chicken (fried chicken in chilli sauce), Bhajiya, Mirchi Bhaji (Whole chilles fried in a batter of gram flour and spices), Masoor ki Daal (red lentil), Baingan bharta (roasted eggplant), Paneer ki Sabji (cottage cheese in tomato sauce), Lamb curry topped off with Pyaz ke Lachhe (onion/tomato salad). The food was flavorful we all relished to our hearts content. Basant was generous enough to share the recipes as well. I was pretty impressed.

Literally everyone was amazing and consistent. The vibe of the location was romantic and classy but still family friendly with a great variety of drinks and food. The rooms were beachside cozy and very clean! The location was also great and there were a variety of activities you could book right at the hotel.

(I'm hispanic traveled with husband and 2 teens, and 2 other family members that are Caucasian) the other family members were treated much better and right in front of us!! It was very obvious. Very dissapointed with this. I have been to many resorts in area and have had soo much better treatment and service. Not a fan of this resort.

8,19-09-2022,"The only two negatives first. The larger of the two pool systems was under construction and inaccessible. We weren’t informed before arriving. Fortunately, as we arrived after the peak season, the remaining pool was easily sufficient to accommodate the guests. We never had an issue finding good poolside lounges. We even changed moved about the pool when we wanted a change. The second negative was the restaurant choices. The breakfast accommodations were quite good, with plenty of options. The Italian restaurant was disappointing but, it’s Mexico and not Italy after all. The French restaurant had a very limited menu and the options didn’t interest us. We ate most of our meals in the beachside seafood restaurant. Plenty of good options. We passed on the Mexican restaurant as my wife can’t handle hot spice. 
The big plus was the staff. In every interaction, the staff was friendly and very attentive. There was a general mood of people content with their work. The facility took great care to sanitize and kept the common and guest rooms neat and clean. The hotel provided live entertainment daily, day and night.

10,12/9/2022,"The food and drinks are mediocre just like any hotel really. The service though is the best I’ve ever received. They’re extremely helpful and caring. I was helped above and beyond multiple times! My boyfriend lost his two phones in the room after we were already at the airport about to board for our flight. One phone call and not only did the front desk operator quickly tell staff to find the phones, he also had a taxi driver on the spot take the phones to the airport all within 25 min so we wouldn’t miss our flight. Just amazing!!!",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
10,12/9/2022,"The snorkeling right off the beach was the best resort snorkeling I've ever had.  Food was great. Drinks were awesome.  Staff was friendly and attentive. Fire show fantastic,  and the pools were awesome

Downside, The room had some mold in the curtains and other various spots.  That made us sneeze quite a bit in the morning.  Probably not the most healthy. Also some crumbling areas on the balconies which needs repair.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,

10,7/9/2022,"Excellent property and staff, everyone was so helpful. Will stay there again.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
6,7/9/2022,"Overall I was underwhelmed. My greatest frustration was meals.  You have to make a reservation a day in advance or you are out of luck on a sit down meal unless you opt for buffet.  Part of being on vacation is the thrill of spontaneous planning and I don’t want to be locked into a reservation time if something comes up during the day.  Some of the restaurants were poorly marked and dark as if they were not intended to be found.  The food was mediocre. I was traveling and thus dining alone and was always steered towards the most lonely table in the entire place.  I eventually started giving guidance on where I wanted to sit and was obliged. 
Generally, the staff was polite. Claudia at the coincerge desk was a great help with arranging transportation.  I did have one encounter upon entering the hotel that startled me. I walked in and was aggressively approached and told that hotel was only for guests.  And then was permitted to pass once he saw my wristband.  Maybe the best approach would have been to ask to see my wristband and then tell me it was only for guests if I didn’t have one.  
The hotel was older than expected, decor dated.  Fresh flowers throughout were a nice touch to give the space some color and life.  My room was good size, very clean, small balcony.
Pool area clean and well maintained.  Have no expectations of long walks on the beach because there is limited access on either side of property, you are pretty much trapped. Easy ferry access.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

A wonderful vacation destination for quite relaxation. If are looking for fun, excitement, flowing booze and dancing this is not your place. No alcohol service before 11am and not available via room service, only at the restaurants, beach and lobby bar. The music at the pool is limited and pretty low key, we had a violinist performe a few times by the pool- I personally loved that but my teenager was not impressed, she would have preferred some pool or activities and entertainment. Definately a better choice for the over 50 croud.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
10,26-08-2022,"The property is beautiful, immaculate, safe, and the staff are welcoming, friendly, and always considerate of the guests.  They all comply with mask wearing despite the guests often refusing to, which shows a deep care for health and safety.  
There was construction going on in a few spots in the resort, resulting in some areas being awful with noise.  One area is actually near the check in desk, so talking to staff and the concierge was very difficult.  So the check in process was not a smooth as it could be.
One other note, the food was amazing, and very accommodating to children.  It would be very helpful if they had at least sample  menus of each restaurant's offering (not necessarily even that night's menu which I know often changes) so you get a good sense of what kind of dishes are offered when you pick your dinner options days in advance.  Our last night, the restaurant my family chose ended up being a bad experience because very little of the menu my family eats.  Had we been able to see a sample menu, we would have chosen a different restaurant.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

10,24-08-2022,"We had an amazing time during our stay at the Grand Fiesta Americana Coral Beach.
This resort has a great location, a short 25-30 minute drive to the Cancun airport and right in the heart of Cancun’s zona hotelera, close to restaurants, shopping and night life.
Their beach is beautiful and clean, while the other resorts struggled with sargassum Coral Beach stayed clean and blue during our stay.
Great food, great drinks and great entertainment. The service was amazing, everyone was so kind and helpful, we were truly blown away by how nice the staff was. 
My only 2 requests would be that at kids club they separate the younger kids from the older ones, my 6 year old was together with the older kids (up to 12yo) and I think that’s too big of an age/size gap especially for certain activities. 
And the second one would be the room temperature, our room thermostat would only go down to 21°C (around 70°F) which after everyone showered with no bathroom ventilation and no ceiling fans some nights it was really hard to have a comfortable sleep with the humidity and temperature. 
Other than that we don’t have any complaints and we will definitely be back! 
Also, shout out to our servers Ivan Vera and Gustavo Arias from the Tuscany restaurant for going above and beyond and putting together an awesome magic show for our kids, definitely one of the highlights of our stay and one of our favorite dinners!",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

The staff is incredible across the board, friendly and accommodating. Super helpful and at the highest levels.

Food quality was good to excellent. Make sure to try the sushi and Mexican restaurants for dinner. The buffet had plenty of options for even the pickiest eaters.

The beach was very nice, fantastic views and (mostly) clean of seaweed. We enjoyed several of the water sports (paddle boards, Sea Doos, etc.). You can even snorkel and see plenty of fish right by the hotel.

Overall a wonderful place to stay. Hope to be back again soon. Five solid stars.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

10,23-08-2022,"This resort is amazing! If you’re looking to have a good time, toh can’t go wrong with this one. We got a free room upgrade to the master suite from our original ocean front room. The views were unreal. During our visit (mid Aug) the capacity wasn’t at peak which honestly made it so much more enjoyable. I went with my husband for our babymoon and it was an amazing time. The resort was so clean and the pool/pool food   bar area was great. The beach itself is beautiful with white sands and the blue water is just breathtaking! Lots of room for us to sit by the pool or the beach. The food was amazing too. Lots of different options and buffets! The 3 restaurants that take reservations (still all inclusive) are delicious! The Italian restaurant has yummy risotto and La Jolla has great food   dessert. The night show at the Nakk Hah restaurant was so good and so was the beach setting of this restaurant. Loved it! I wanna come back with my fam again :) 

The service and cleanliness is impeccable. Room service   cleaning is top notch. Thank you to the entire team!",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
8,22-08-2022,"It was very family friendly. Unfortunately the Nightclub in the hotel was not active as it was under construction as they said to us.

10,19-08-2022,"We loved everything about this resort!!! We tried almost all the restaurants and our favorite was La Basilica, it is worth the $50 extra you have to pay.  All the other restaurants were also excellent.  Their buffet was excellent.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The wait staff on the beach and the pool was excellent, it was like they knew your drink was almost gone and they were there.  The rooms were nice and clean and the turn-down service was excellent.  I would definitely go back to this resort.  We were 4 adults they accommodated with rooms right beside each other and the balcony were right next to each other so we could hang out when we wanted to.  There were some kids around that we didn't care for, but you can upgrade to executive and that area is adults only.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

8,16-08-2022,The property was very clean room was great the only thing was everything was closed by 11pm if I payed for an all inclusive hotel that’s what I expect.  A sports bar would be great to serve alcohol snacks and entertainment for adults after hours. It felt like I was a teen with a curfew if 11 because literally there was nothing to do on the property after 11 but otherwise my vacation was great,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
10,15-08-2022,"This resort was the bomb! It was clean, the staff were really nice, the food and dining options were good(especially the vegetarian option), and they offered shows and activities for the family and grown folks. And the resort is right off of the beautiful beach(they keep it clean). I would definitely recommend this resort, especially with the all inclusive(free unlimited) drinks and food and it’s right next to the strip of clubs and bars(like a 3-5 minute walk). I truly enjoyed my stay here with family. Ima definitely come back!",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
10,15-08-2022,"Great hotel. Doesnt look that grand from the front aspect, but dont let that fool you. Staff so hard working and always extremely polite and helpful. Very clean. Swimming pools and balcony views absolutely amazing. Breakfast buffet ideal. Even though 5 *  it wasnt really formal and felt comfortable bringing children. My only criticisms are the games room off the lobby is only open in the evening and can get quite busy. It would be great if kids can use it during the day too when you just want to relax in the hotel. They have a kids club but its age 3-12. My kids didnt want to go and mix with younger ones so the hotel could benefit from more facilties for pre-teens to socialise in. Also the wait for ordering at the pool bar can be quite some time. They are just rushed off their feet and more staff needed in that area. Food wise we tried a few of the restaurants for evening meals, adult choices lovely but there wasnt much option for kids. Stuck to buffet breakfast, cafe grab n go, pool bar and room service most of the time. Lots of places to eat outside in the hotel zone but as its all inclusive you feel you should eat at the hotel. Overall would definitely recommend staying here.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

8,12/8/2022,Overall pleasing environment. The beach is probably the best part of this Resort. The entire resort is extremely clean. Twice a day room service was great. Few in-resort dining options were great like the Mexican Restaurant and the Buffet and some were very disappointing. Some staff were very helpful and welcoming and on the other hand some really didn't care like the girls at the restaurant reservation desk. Not enough entertainment staff around the pools for sports like beach/pool volleyball etc. No night club at the resort. Spa was good. I liked the no-pressure of buying their membership. We will definitely stay there again.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

4,10/8/2022,"BEWARE OF THEIR VACATION CLUB MEMBERSHIP!!!
ITS A FRAUD...they SELL YOU TIMESHARE by lying to you.
When we stayed at this hotel our stay at this hotel was okay, it turned into a bad experience when when we figured the fiesta Americana vacation club membership that had convinced us to buy was based on FRADULENT MARKETING. Their agents told us that the membership is not timeshare and we signed the documents wherever they pointed on their little iPad believing them. Since, its hard to see the entire page on an iPad when you are signing the deal. After we came back to US and I looked at my documents its a timeshare membership and they left me with a $25,000 bill for a WRONG ADVERTISEMENT and I gave them $6000 as down payment that I have been trying to recover from them and cancel my membership without any luck. I have made multiple calls and emails and I still have not resolve.

Not a reflection on the hotel though, just be mindful of this when booking.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

The person picking us up was 30 min late, dropped us off at the wrong pier and we were sent on the wrong boat. We had no one to pick us up until a bartender was able to speak with our hotel. My next complaint was on the food. It was hit and miss. We had breakfast twice from room service. They were very timely and our orders were correct. The food one time was just ok, the next breakfast was very good. We made reservations for dinner 3 nights. 2 out of 3 were good. The staff were very good.

The staff and service at the property were exceptional!!!!  I can’t say enough about that….everyone was so attentive and hospitable.
  
The downside, the resort beach size is underwhelming and too many kids in the pools jumping, splashing around and sitting at the pool bars.  It would be great to have one of the four pools be designated for adults only, a swim up bar and with DJ music!",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

We traveled with two little ones so the only thing that I did not see was a section in the pool with toys for them. I did see a picture in their website but not sure where it was. We would definitely go back. We stayed a Ziva last year and I personally like this one over Ziva.

Sexy, but classy could be their motto.
There is a dress code for dining, so if you plan on going straight to the pool afterwards - be sure to wear a coverup.  Most people were fully dressed. 
Also, you have to make reservations for dinner 2 days prior to your dining experience,  so you should stop at the table to make them right  after checking in. If you like working out - the gym is great, bring your gymshoes and workout attire. Their adults only resort 'Live Aqua,' is a bit more tranquil in my opinion, but overall I like them both :-)",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

We wish there would have been more casual dining restaurants to choose from that didn’t require reservations. We went on a couple of tours and got back to the hotel late. The only restaurant available was the buffet. But it was serving the same Italian food that we had the first night we arrived. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay and would definitely go back!!",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

10,28-07-2022,"I love the guest service. Every single employee at this hotel is super friendly and willing to help/answer any questions. 
They really took care of us and were very accommodating! 

The pool and beach area is maintained daily so it is beautiful! 

Alex - one of the pool meseros is so nice!! He was awesome! I purposely sat in his area each day so he would be our waiter!! He already knew our orders and made sure we always had drinks in our hands! IYKYK! Gracias Alex por ser tan amable! 

We felt safe the entire time. They had amazing evening shows in the theater, out on the beach and in the pool area. They also have a venders market that comes out with unique mexican finds. 

Rooms are clean and staff restocks the mini bar daily, clean the rooms and puts new towels daily! 

This is our second year back to Gran Fiesta Americana Coral Beach and we decided to become members to continue enjoying all that this hotel has to offer.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
8,28-07-2022,"We just spent a week and had a great time! 

Check in: was very efficient.  But be prepared for a slight wait if there is a line, process takes a little bit
Staff: everyone was great
Room: glad we were in the West tower, loved the ocean front location and room size, beds comfortable, mini bar and snacks were included
Housekeeping: some days were better than others, dust bunnies under the dresser, overall okay-nice and tidy, shower faucet would not completely shut off so tub appeared dirty from water calcium
Pools: great! we went down by 8am to get specific lounge chairs with shade
Beach: very nice-.there is a little seaweed in the water, but can easily walk past it.  
Bars: most of the drinks were not very strong, but they were tasty. 
Food/Restaurants: hit or miss; some food was great and some not so much. Filet at Isla Contoy was so tough could barely cut through it.  Blackened Tuna at lunch was delicious. Try the churros at the Mexican restaurant!  Room service was good.  At all locations, they only provide margarine (real butter should be offered).
Entertainment: not much offered - Fire show was good, liked violin by pool side

Although it is an all-inclusive, we went prepared to tip and are glad we did.  All of the servers/bartenders worked very hard and deserved it!",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

However I was extremely disappointed with my overall stay, let me start by stating that the food was terrible, they couldn't even make good breakfast! The entertainment and music was depressing, they keep playing sad music I did not see one person that was in-charge of the entertainment. The room I was in had a leak and the bathrooms had mold.

The only thing that I did not enjoy was the selling of the time shares or vacation membership.  I had a choice to not listen to the presentation so that is my fault.  Also, although our room was very clean and the service amazing from turn down service and cleaning every day, my own complaint in the cleanliness would be the hallways.

La calidad de la comida es buena, sin ser extraordinaria.
La única crítica sería con relación a la limpieza y el mantenimiento de la habitación. Por ejemplo, había polvo y pelusas abajo de los muebles y en el baño se hacía un charco de agua en una esquina fuera de la tina y un par de días no lo secaron; por otra parte, se salía el agua de la llave de la tina y nunca lo fueron a reparar.
Sin embargo, con gusto regresaríamos a este hotel.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

10,8/7/2022,"Our party of 10 had a great time at this resort.  While it could use some renovations in the rooms and common areas it was very clean and well taken care of.  The whole resort was huge and we never felt overwhelmed with people.  As others stated you should make dining reservations after check-in.  We got a chance to try every restaurant and I would recommend doing so.  Our party had mixed reviews on which ones we enjoyed the most, however we can all agree that Andres, Floriberto and Salvader were amazing at Vina Del Mar.  They delivered extra service, remembering our drinks and even offered us off the menu items.  They were a great start to our day.  La Isla Contoy was a great option for lunch if you did not want to eat poolside/beachside.  Ask for Edgar, you will not regret it.  If you choose to stay poolside look for Rene, he was awesome!!! On top of every drink and food request.  Overall we had a great time and would definitely visit this resort again in the future.

One small thing... upon check in we were told that there was a $10 environmental fee that had to be paid?  It was not disclosed when we booked through Expedia but nevertheless we paid it.  Oddly another party that came with us same party size and nights their fee was only $8, not sure why there was a difference.  Nevertheless small detail that was an annoyance but did not alter our experience.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

10,6/7/2022,"Awesome for families. Kid Zone was amazing. My kids 7 and 9 were thoroughly entertained throughout the day. Was able to secure a wheelchair for my mother the entire 4 day stay and the place is very ADA compliant.

The rooms were beautiful. Perfect views and rooms cleaned at least twice a day. Coming back to the room from dinner with fresh bed, water, and chocolate was nice. 

Food was delicious. I have gone to a plenty resorts and the food is always so so but not here. I really enjoyed the restaurants. 

Also, it was surprisingly off the party strip. Didn't get a chance to explore but plenty of bars and restaurants walking distance to the resort and none of the noise was heard on site. 

Very few negatives: As a champagne snob, the champs was terrible and destroyed my mimosas lol and the night shows were in a pretty small space but otherwise an EXCELLENT stay!",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

Too many chairs on beach.  Most are not being used during day so fewer chairs on beach to give a bit more privacy would be a good idea.  Too few wait staff in beach area so cannot easily get a drink or food without going to pool bar to place order.  Service on beach very slow.

The door stopper placement is odd making the door unable to open all the way. I hit my right knee a couple of times. Yet over-all, I will say that the hotel’s location, service, and amenities make our stay a wonderful experience!",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

8,1/6/2022,"We upgrade to Beach Front room. Amazing View. 
I am a picky eater and the food was ok, lot of stuff you can't understand on menus, very different food. I like the Buffets you are able to see what your eating. Resort is smaller and the pools and ocean are nice. Not many activities on the resort regarding shows unless you book excursions. Covid Test set Up was easy to get back to US. 
Walking distance to a strip if your interested to go off resort. 
I had to check out in person which I have not done at a hotel in a long time. 
Over all good stay and nice room.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
10,1/6/2022,"Ya habiamos ido antes, y en esta ocasion fuimos a Celebrar Renovacion de votos matrimoniales (20 años) en este hotel. Definitivamente el servicio e instalaciones sigue siendo excelente e impecable.
Las instalaciones son buenas, pero la actitud de servicio de todo el pesonal es excelente, en el cual destaco a la supervisora de playa/alberca Berenice quien nos atendio y nos dio soporte de manera extraordinaria todos los dias y en todo lo que pudimos necesitar.
En los restaurantes en especial el mesero Andres se destaca en amabilidad y servicio.
El restaurante para cenar ""Isla Contoy"" es muy bueno y el encargado da soporte personalizado - hubo una confusion en mi reservacion y lo soluciono rapidamente. 
El equipo de  eventos es asombroso - La Gerente de Bodas Lizeth nos dio soporte en todo momento, y esto hizo que el evento que nos ayudo a planear estuviera perfecto para nosotros. Definitivamente se destaco en servicio y atenciones.
El equipo de fotografia y video del hotel es extraordinario -  fue definitivamente la culminacion total del evento, porque con las fotografias que tomo Jessy y el video que edito Pamela lograron plasmar todas las emociones que sentimos en este evento, lo hicieron magico. 
Jessy eres la mejor en fotografias.
Es un hotel al que volveremos cada vez que nos sea posible - porque se destacan en atencion y servicio al cliente - realmente TODO el equipo que trabaja ahi hace de este un hotel excelente y la mejor opcion a visitar en Cancun.

6,29-05-2022,"Staff were very nice. Though we had a couple of checkout and housekeeping issues and the restaurants’ waiting staff were not as attentive towards the end of our stay (and yes, we did tip generously). 

Amenities were sufficient. The pools were great. Beach was a bit limited but had an amazingly fine and powdery sand. 

Food was okay. From the included restaurants, La Joya Mexican restaurant was our favorite. Isla Contoy was nice with a gorgeous view. Other restaurants were subpar. Coral beach cafe was very basic, to put it mildly. Buffets were okay, but they could add more specialty items. 

The only two high end restaurants, the Table and Le Basilic, were both extra and adults only.

Burgers and pizzas were particularly bad at all their eateries, consistently. Pizza was a pan fried half-baked dough all three times we ordered (and did not eat). Kids ended up having either mac and cheese or chicken nuggets on every meal. 

A proper pizza oven and improving the Cafe’s desserts/food/appearance would be easy wins for the hotel to enhance the experience of the guests, specially the ones with kids.

Kids club saved our trip — for sure the most important advantage of this resort. Well maintained with attentive staff in a safe setup for drop-ins for kids older than 3 years old. I only wish they had another pool time in the afternoon in their daily program.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

So we were assigned a side Suite # 1054 with a Full L Balcony , Jacuzzi Tub (couldn't use it because the water tab was broken, it was fixed ;later), Massive Bathroom, Dinning Area, Sitting Area, Massive Stand Up Shower.

They gave the best customer service, everything was really clean, they made all the processes easy (making dinner reservations, scheduling Covid test, getting the Covid test, etc). The pools and swim up bars were great. The breakfast buffet has so much stuff, way more than I would have thought! I got an omelet from the omelet station everyday, so good! 

But most of all, they were just SO NICE and helpful and accommodating! We couldn’t get over how nice all the staff were. We didn’t come across one mean or grumpy employee the entire time. They always went above and beyond anytime we asked for something. 

I’d definitely recommend this place and will definitely be back!",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

Now for the not so good review. For the $$ I spent at this resort I wasn't blown away by the food. This is not a review on the servers because they were amazing and all deserve recognition for how good they are. Vina Del Mar for breakfast and a dinner buffet (AWESOME). Isla Contoy - the view is great, staff is great that's about it.  Tuscany for Italian - great. La Joya -  just blah. Le Basilic - AMAZING worth every penny extra to go. Nah K'aax worth it for the beach vibe for sure. Food was fine.  Drinks are plentiful anywhere you go. WINE? 2 choices of red and both are bad - I would have gladly paid extra for a better glass. So that's the bad part of my review but other than that this is a stunning resort and worth a visit.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
4,12/5/2022,"We just returned home from a 5 nights vacation at Grand Fiesta Americana in Cancun. I would NOT rate this hotel as a 5 star hotel for the following reasons:
1. Rooms are outdated.
2. More than half of the staff we encountered speak none or very limited English.
3. Only one big swimming pool, there’s not even a jacuzzi in this hotel! Kids pools are VERY small, there’s no water slides for kids.
4. Swimming pool/beach waiters are NOT attentive at all!!! This is our 4th all inclusive vacation in the Caribbean and also the most expensive so far. Yet the beach waiters are the most reluctant to serve. Totally unacceptable!!! Btw we tipped them every time food/drinks were bought to us.
5. Service of staff at the restaurants is a hit and miss. Some of them are attentive and some are definitely not. Again, I would expect all staff to have decent customer service at this price range hotels.
6. Not a great food selection at the buffet restaurant. In fact, all restaurants are pretty small
7. Kids club is NOT CLEAN! Both of my kids got sick after going to the kids club
8. Spa is definitely over priced. Again I don’t recommend anyone to spend the premium for spa at this hotel. 

This is a disappointing stay for us. We will not be returning to this hotel in our next trip to Cancun. And I do NOT recommend people to spend the  premium to stay at this hotel. You simply don’t get your money worth of service here. There are so many hotels and options in Cancun so stay somewhere else!!",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
10,11/5/2022,"My family had excellent vacation while staying at Grand Fiesta Americana. Hotel prpoerty is clean, good service and nice variety of foods.  I wish to come back again and again‼‼",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
10,10/5/2022,"Clean, they take great care to follow Covid cleanliness protocols. Excellent service from EVERYONE! 

They had live entertainers - ballet dancing at the French restaurant, mariachi at the Mexican, poolside violin & cello playing modern music, tango at the buffet, live band at the lobby, acrobatic acts by the pool. 

I loved all the restaurants. You pay additional for the French but don’t miss out, it’s worth it. 

The pools were huge! Lots of kiddos but because there were so many large pools, it didn’t feel crowded or annoying. 

They have a long coastline. Waters were gorgeous up until two days ago (May 8) when seaweed slowly started to roll in. It wasn’t big amounts, still swimmable, but the color change was clearly noticeable in just a few days time. 

I can’t comment on walkability because I had no plans to put on pants and step outside resort grounds. 
Zero safety concerns in the resort. There were lots of staff in various uniforms and name tags keeping an eye out for everything.

They have kayaking, jet skis and other water activities you can book right there on the beach. 

My previous stays in Cancun have been at various Riu hotels, and I loved all of them. But the food and service at Grand Fiesta Americana were head and shoulders above. 
Be nice, be appreciative, and they will go out of their way to make special requests happen. 

We had a wonderful time!",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

Carlos at the pool always was available to take our orders and the servers at the Restaurants are amazing. The night entertainment was also worth it. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and can't speak enough on how fantastic this hotel is.I will only ask that they look into the policy of parents not getting visibility to the kids club. I didn't feel comfortable dropping my kids without getting a tour of the place or seeing the activities my kids will partake in. Parents need to be able to tour the facility to be comfortable in dropping off their kids.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
2,8/5/2022,Hotel employees are not well trained. They are not professional at all. Room floor is very slippery.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
2,7/5/2022,"When we arrived at the hotel first impression was really awful, they didn’t welcome us with water or anything. The front desk were very rude. Then we got to the room first dinner was ok nothing special. Then after the first night the room didn’t have hot water, so I had to shower my 2 little kids with cold water. Second something wrong with the shower head was leaking water all night. Third the room was not clean properly and I have pictures. They offered us insurance when we got to the hotel, and I bought it. Then out our group of 30 people, I’m the only tested positive because I bought the insurance so you guys can collect money from the insurance. I tested outside negative and I tested again once I entered USA and still negative. Then after I bought the insurance, they said I have to test again at the hotel with extra charge. Then why would you offer insurance to people if it doesn’t cover anything! 
The food at the hotel is horrible, almost no good food at all. We were eating cheese, chicken, and steak Quesadilla the whole trip :( The AC thermostat  doesn’t work, you can’t control the AC
We brought a floaty with us, they told us can’t use it at the pool, where can we use it! 
We went to the kids club was no 
Electricity and outside but only had 30 people capacity, what??
They use the copy and paste method without using their heads, truly sad.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
8,7/5/2022,"The food is ok, I was a little disappointed that there was not a lunch buffet like most resorts have. The only options were sea food an the taco stand, but you did have the option to order room service. 
The breakfast buffet never changed. The Italian restaurant was ok, la Joya was amazing!!
The resort can use a good paint job, inside and out but overall it was nice. The best part is the beach. There is absolutely 0 seaweed. The beach was definitely worth the price. There was more party life next door at Riu. But we liked the quiet environment. The staff is amazing. They will try to offer you the time share breakfast right after check in but I said no thank you and told the young lady that was being very pushy. The room was great, they all overlooked the ocean.

10,6/5/2022,"This was our first visit to Cancun. The Grand Fiesta Coral Beach was beyond all our expectations. It starts with the staff and their happy, positive attitude in all they do. Their focus is to make us happy, no matter what. The facility and rooms are spotless.The grounds flow to the ocean. There are multiples pools, lagoons, seating areas, three pools side bars with stools in the water, restaurants overlooking the pools and ocean. All food and drinks are included and the bartenders will do their best to make whatever makes you happy. The restaurants were great. Breakfast buffet or table served had a wide range of fruits, rolls, cereals, made to order omelettes, sausages, bacon, and a wide range of cheeses, yogurts, name  it and it was there. 
Entertainment started with the poolside cellist and violinist midday and continued  with water aerobics and water polo in one pool at 11AM and 12PM and late into the night with a DJ or live band in the lobby bar. Some dinners did cost extra and were worth the charge. Le Basilic (French) has a 6 course dinner with live piano and even two ballet dancers performing during dinner. the waiter Manuel was a treat with his performing and attention to his diners.The meal was an event that was unexpected and magical. Evening dinner on the beach was also not to be missed. You can tell we thoroughly enjoyed our stay of 8 days. We were impressed by the staff and their genuine joy in making us comfortable and happy.

10,17-04-2022,"We spend one week at this property with a family of 4 from April 9 to 16. Overall exceptionally friendly and helpful through, everything very well organized. We particularly enjoyed eating at their buffet restaurant, Vina del Mar, for breakfast and dinner. Every day a different selection with regional dishes to try. For lunch we usually went with the numerous snack options of the pool-side bars. Of the other restaurant options we tried La Joya which was excellent, while we were disappointed by the Italian restaurant and the beach side bar/restaurant. Only thing we did not like was the reservation system for some of the restaurants: unless you made theses reservation right after check in on your arrival day, there would either no opening or only very late dinner slots.

That being said, we would whole heartedly recommend this property!",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

Regarding food/restaurants, we had an awesome dinner our last night there at La Joya restaurant which was our favorite. The buffet for breakfast never wowed. We never went for lunch or dinner. The Tuscany Italian restaurant was great. And I forget the name of the seafood restaurant located outside near the pools but our one lunch experience there was good as well. Besides La Joya, which was very good, all of the other food offerings were good but not great. And we didn’t go to the French restaurant because it was an adults only location and we didn’t want split from our kids. But all in all, 5 stars out of 5 is what I would give Grand Fiesta Americana Coral Beach. We totally recommend it and would go there again.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

The staff was so friendly and accommodating. The room was cleaned twice a day and the view from the balcony was unbelievable. The food in every restaurant was delicious. The night entertainment was different and fun every night. There wasn’t much entertainment during the day but the violinist and cello player by the pool was different and beautiful.

10,14-04-2022,Excellent service and hospitality. The food was fresh and great variety daily. The hotel is a bit run down and needs a makeover but the beach makes up for it. The staff is super friendly and go extra mile to make you comfortable.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

8,12/4/2022,Fantastic service and friendly staff. Excellent experience at spa. Only reason I won’t be going back to this property is the lack of adult only areas on the property. Way too many unruly and inconsiderate kids/parents for my liking.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

10,12/4/2022,I was there with my family and it was an amazing experience for all of us. It was so good that We wanted to extend our stay there but we couldn’t. The only thing that I would like to mention is that the cleaning of our room it wasn’t the best ever. They were cleaning it twice a day and still were some papers and rubbish standing there for 3-4 days. But everything else was perfect,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
2,11/4/2022,"The management is beyond rude, the worst I’ve ever experienced in any hotel i have ever been in. 

Their policies make zero sense and if you had a friend staying at another hotel in the area, who came to meet you for dinner or anything, they won’t even let them in the front door. I will be calling Expedia to put in a formal complaint in the next 24 hours when I return from out of country.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

8,8/4/2022,"I have been so many resorts in the Caribbean but I’ve never experienced service that this hotel provided which is beyond my words. The rooms are outdated and could use some updating. The ONLY complain I would have is the food. There is no food variety at all. I have not eaten steak or chicken in 5 days so we went to a steakhouse and paid across the street. If you love food this is not the place for you, however the food that they actually serve it tastes good. Also they do not have any kids entertainment during the day at all like other resorts.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

10,31-03-2022,"Highly recommend the Fiesta Americana Grand Coral Beach. Transportation was arranged and was fantastic. Friendly staff, in all areas of the hotel and highly attentive.  We were upgraded to a beautiful, huge room, that was clean, comfortable and nicely appointed. Gorgeous view from our 10th floor balcony. The beach is so nice, clean and swimmable due to being near the point which is protected from the high surf. Each restaurant we ate at was pretty good.  My favorite was the tacos, sopas and quesadillas from the pool side bar and my son loved the ice cream, burgers and french toast. The staff was very attentive on the beach and at the pool, always bringing drinks and food. There was a security guard that was present near the beach/pool and gave me sense of comfort. The jet ski rental was fun as well as the SUP, and the staff was great there too. We watched 2 night shows at the pool which were entertaining. Neat location at the end of the hotel zone, close to Copa Cabana, which was crazy busy.  The hotel is clean and modern, beds were comfy, and the A/C worked great. Room service was also awesome, good burgers and quick. Will return.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

8,31-03-2022,"What I liked was the Staff and Cleanliness of Resort. Pool area Large and ample room for adults, kids and Business groups. Great service always outstanding. Food and options are limited and OK. although I didn't go Hungry. Did upgrade status to a VIP level, that is where I feel it falls short. Really wasn't worth the upgrade. VIP or Elite Club is not really located on convenient Floor or location close to rooms. Like most Concierge's levels are on same floor. Elite Outdoor Bar & Lounge is not close to pool area. Upgrade Liquor is only at those two Bar areas and not in Restaurants, which was told we were able to get access to higher level wine choices and Premium Liquor. Not the case. Paid for bottle of wine.  Very Nice Experience and would recommend for families for sure. Not a Foodie place but Staff is amazingly accommodating and you feel you are there #1 Priority. Covid19 you are covered! This is the place for you if you have any concerns. Spa which was not aware of when booking was amazing! That is a experiance in its self. Highly Recommend a visit for sure.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

10,31-03-2022,"The beach is truly gorgeous: soft, white sand & waves every shade of turquoise. At first, we were slightly disappointed that it's not connected to the larger beach of the hotel zone, as it's a bit inconvenient - hot & loud - to access the larger, walkable beach through the party strip off Kukulcan Blvd. However, we appreciated that the hotel beach is gentler/more swimmable.

We liked our room very much. Having a 9th floor balcony overlooking paradise is dreamy. The bathroom was due for an upgrade, which could be a turnoff if you're jazzed for a daily, spa-like experience, but we didn't care. 

It took us a couple of days to figure out when, where & how to get food throughout the day. We preferred the quieter areas of the pools & beach and the wait staff didn't attend them as frequently, plus we'd often lose track of time. Book restaurant reservations as early as possible if you'd like to eat before 9pm. 24-hr room service is an awesome perk.

Getting around the hotel zone is pretty easy. Walking is doable, if it's not too far (it's hot). Catching a red bus is fun (12 pesos/person, one-way) BUT plan your stop ahead of time and hang on tight, since no one is going to baby you. We spent an overcast afternoon at the Mayan Museum/San Miguelito Archeological Site, which is a refreshing slice of jungle & history in the hotel zone. (Side note: Prepare to take a thousand pictures of geckos & iguanas!)

Last, but not least, the service is fantastic. Really. Tip them.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

I love the traditional Mexican feel of this hotel which includes beautiful accents all over the property reminding us of the culture and tradition in Mexico. This is not some cookie cutter impersonal all inclusive like so many in the area, this is a luxury hotel that has a wonderful staff that treat every guest with kindness and true hospitality.

8,25-03-2022,I stayed here 3 years ago and it was better . The location is great . I think it’s time for a little spruce up it’s starting to look dated . The all inclusive was great because of the alcohol but the food was fair at best . I was very annoyed by their obsession with mask . It actually feels like you’re being followed just to see if you’re wearing one . I know it’s their policy but I do think they overdue it,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

2,23-03-2022,"Not a 5 star hotel, when I looked at the prices at Expedia, this hotel is more expensive than Hyatt Ziva, which is right beside this hotel so we decided on this one because we want to stay in a nicer 5 star hotel and we don't mind paying more but unfortunely we did not get what we paid for. Website advertised free hotel transfer but it's false, we paid $70usd each trip which is fine as long we got a private car. But on the 2nd last day we wanted to request another private car to the airport, we were told to just take the taxi, and we had to argue with the conceirge to get them to arrange a car for us. There is no car rental, no currency exchange, no exchange from big bills to smaller bills, poor management. We told some restaurants were adults only and at the end we see kids entering the adult only restaurants, and we went with our son and we were not allow to enter and when we questioned them, they told us there is an exemption, when we ask what is the exemption, there was no answer. All restaurants even the buffet did not allow sleeveless and my husband had to change, then we saw a few people entering the restaurant sleeveless. So what is that about? Double standard. Hotel room is extremely old and bad wifi. Only good thing are extremely hard working pool staff, wait staff, and cleaning staff, and room service. The management and check in staff is total garage. We didn't even feel safe putting my son to the kids club most of the days because it's closed off",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

If it gets full to the capacity (which happened during our March-break stay), it gets pretty busy and hard to get a spot under a shade, although staff is doing great job trying to please customers. Beach is great, almost no seaweed at least during our stay. Pools are amazing too. Food is good and plenty, buffet does not have too many options though, best to book all restaurants and that way have variety during dinner time. Overall very pleased with first stay in Mexico, thank you.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
10,21-03-2022,"This has been our favorite hotel in Cancun for many, many years. Unfortunately due to the pandemic and some changes in the way the hotel does business, it has gone downhill somewhat. One of the things we did not like at all is that is has gone all-inclusive. That diminishes the quality of the food served in the restaurants. Also, service in the pool area could have been better. Staff was attentive once you got their attention, but there simply weren't enough of them to attend to all the guests around the pool. The hotel, however, is very conveniently located and the beach is great because it doesn't have as much current as the other hotels further down the coast have.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico
8,21-03-2022,It was clean and relaxing. The pools were great and there was always a place with shade when needed. The service was great and friendly. The only negative was the lack of top shelf liquor and the food was just ok.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

4,20-03-2022,Well where do I begin … when we arrived at the hotel the check in process was very unpleasant. The guy attending us seemed to be in a bad mood . Other stays I’ve enjoyed over the years the check in process was smooth and great . The sales pitch right after we received our room keys was annoying and the guy was not taking no for an answer til we were firm with him . Things were going great til they tried kicking me out of the room a day early . I had booked a two bedroom suite which was very misleading since it’s just a connecting room with a door in the middle. They tried kicking me out one of the conjoined rooms and I had to go argue with the front desk which was time consuming and distasteful since they came into our room twice without asking and or knocking and my young daughter was there alone which I didn’t like . How ever it gets worse. We had a group of our friends come with us which we’re staying in another two rooms on a separate floor and towards the end of the night they would hang out on the balcony having drinks in on of the rooms . Well to their surprise on one of the nights while being on the balcony a man that was hotel staff was on my friends balcony since he figured no one was there ! No privacy man . How many people have access to the room other than the room cleaning people ?! I’ve been to Cancun enough times and I can honestly say I did not feel safe in this hotel what do ever . Very disappointed to the degree if they gave me a week free here I’d deny it.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico

Second: the property is massive and very packed w guests and the buffet area can only accommodate 30 people. I waited 20 min for an omelette every time.  Some of the foods had to be dispensed by staff while others didn’t.  Makes zero sense.   When the staff is busy or not there you couldn’t get the food.

So we stopped going there, also had a bad experience when we paid $300 for an excursion at the hotel after we told the lady we had medical problems she still sold us and excursion that was not for us so I feel that I paid $300 to just drink water, eat,sit and watch everyone have a good time that was a big disappointment.

- Property has a beautiful beach and a pool and the staff was hard at work day and night keeping it clean and sanitized.

They were the handful of people that worked at the bar with the swing that was not very kind of professional, and one front desk person that was not great. Everyone else was amazing. In particular, the people in the urban bar upstairs were great. The two tile guys who did the excursions by the pool were amazing the servers at the cabanas and lounge on the beach was amazing.

2,23-08-2023,"I will never book a vacation through Expedia not only did I pay over 5,000 dollars but they false advertise the resort, in my reservation It clearly stated that breakfast and dinner was included.  When I got to the resort they informed me that these issues have happed before with Expedia because the resort does not offer an all exclusive.  After flighting practically all day I called Expedia and they had me on hold for 45min and nothing got resolved.  I ended up spending over 1000.00 more just on food.  I am beyond me they are not only false advertising but refused to take any responsibility on their part for the issues they caused me and my family.  Again I will never chose Expedia to plan a vacation!!!",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico

4,20-08-2023,They treat you like your not even paying them if you didn’t get the all inclusive. The front desk is very rude. The cleaners and water service people are very nice and the restaurant workers are amazing. The bar people are nice.

6,4/7/2023,"The inconsistent information I received regarding the $50 credit, was not appreciated and deceiving. Upon check-in, I was told I was entitled to $100 credit per stay not per $50 per day. The following day, I asked for clarification, my reservation per Expedia and the hotel site said $50 credit per day. I was told it was $150 per stay.  I didn't fight it. I check out and then I was told I had a credit of $50 per day that did not roll over to another day and that I had a balance. Grr... This is RIDICULOUS. We came with another family and this happened to them. I've seen another review with the same complaint.  What a shame that these games are played. It's very poor customer service and you are LYING to the consumer.

The morning server in the Club lounge is too slow; get your cappuccino from machine because your coffee is offered after you have eaten your breakfast. 
Francisco from the bar was sweet, HONEST, and a very hard worker. 
My housekeeper was a GEM. 
The front staff for check-in: SCAMMERS.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico

Solo para secuestrar tu vehículo y su mafia siga operando , es una pena que suceda eso , lamentable. Eso estaría penado en un país como Estados Unidos , a menos que pongan una advertencia , de valet parking, pero en la publicidad define estacionamiento gratuito , de verdad eso me decepciono muchísimo.

8,23-05-2023,"Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Presidente.  Overall a very good stay and place!  First the few negatives.
The main restaurant El Caribeno was a big disappointment the one night we had dinner there.  The sommelier was an enthusiastic young man, but gave us a recommendation for a Mexican Shiraz that was bad.  Only finished half the bottle (probably should not have let him talk us into a Mexican wine in the first place, haha). We could have sent it back but just decided not too. The rest of the wait staff was slow and not very cordial.  We ordered rib eye tacos and they were terrible.  A frozen taco dinner from the grocery store would have been just as good.

Now the mostly positives.  The other onsite restaurant, ale Cap Beach Club served us drinks and snacks to order during the day while lounging on the beach.  Good drinks and snacks.  Josue was our waiter and was excellent and checked on us at appropriate times and was quite friendly.  We had club level 2 queen suite with ocean view which was very nice!  A sitting room separate from bedroom and a second half bath and 2 large screen TVs.  Maid service 3 times daily!  Also kept plenty of bottled water for us.  With the club rooms you get a delicious buffet breakfast included in the very spacious club lounge, plus each day from 6-8pm complementary drinks and appetizers.  The service and waiters each day for boy( breakfast and afternoon refreshments were outstanding!  The beach at this property is beautiful and water",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico

2,1/1/2023,This hotel is far away from everything. No restaurants nearby. The restaurants in the hotel are overpriced. The rooms need to be remodeled. The bathrooms have a smell. There are many choices in the hotel zone. Avoid this hotel.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico
8,1/1/2023,Está perfecto solo no me gusto que no me reconocieron como socio de IHG ni de Expedía que en otras propiedades siempre lo hacen.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico

Clean room.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico
10,24-12-2022,"Seasoned traveler here, traveled many places on many different levels and this property is well maintained with a spectacularly laid out beach and pool area.  We opted for the club lever and the breakfast was excellent. I'd recommend for families and travelers on all levels.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico
6,22-12-2022,"The resort seems a bit old. Our room could be very noisy depending on hall traffic.  Finally, our air conditioning was crazy....on/off on/off constantly.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico
10,18-12-2022,"Had a wonderful stay. Property is inviting, comfortable, staff are friendly and not invasive. You feel at home.

6,18-12-2022,"Be careful when booking this hotel.  Call first to find out if they are doing any repairs or painting or in our case VARNISHING.  The fumes from varnishing was so strong as if it was coming through the air ducts directly into our room on the fifth floor.  We endured this for 2 days until the supervisor switched us to a different room.  We paid for a club level then had to move to a basic room in the tower.  Their commercial shows a high level of customer service and ""Luxury"".  There front desk staff is NOT trained to handle situations like this for a SUPPOSED world class hotel.  I have stayed here before and noticed that basically guest are supposed to accept whatever inconveniences arise and without any warnings....It's so unprofessional and it shows NO CLASS....they were even bleaching the pool area walkway while we were walking to have dinner and stepping on the bleached water they were rinsing....and this was early in the evening...they could have done that later when everyone was asleep like other resorts do....Anyway,  My last stay has left me confused now on how this place should be rated.  Was it  a down time so they have to do some repairs or touch-ups but what about the guest who stay during those down times?  And they waited to give us another room...and had to settle for a basic room when I paid more for our club level room and the problem was caused by the hotel....Be careful with this hotel everyone!",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico

The room I stayed in could use a little updating / polishing, but was nice (and a very affordable rate) - no major complaints at all.

6,15-10-2022,"The property is beautiful but they over charge you for everything. Don’t buy from the on-site travel agent because it will cost you double. The surrounding area is impoverished and full of people who will scam you in a heart beat. Honestly, I’m not sure that the hotels are doing anything for the people who actually live in the surrounding community because you can see the wealth  gap clearly if you drive just 8 minutes down the street. It is troubling to see so many homes without doors. I asked the manager what the hotel does to give back to the community and the response was, “we do what we can”. I was very uncomfortable with this answer because, they charge so much and everything is an up charge, I would feel better about paying more if the hotel at least gave back to their community.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico

10,5/7/2022,"I have been to this hotel numerous times. The beach is wonderful (no seaweed) and large. Rooms are very nice with comfortable beds. I do not like the bathroom layout (even in club level rooms it is weird) but that has no bearing on my rating. Pools are nice. Beach and pool service is the best ANYWHERE. Martiniano has been taking care of us for 20 plus years and he is very attentive. Breakfast buffet didn't have much I liked (fussy) so we only ate there once and walked to VIPS the other mornings. Lunch at the beach/pool is fantastic. Fajitas, chicken wings and burgers are all excellent. Did not eat there at night as there are so many wonderful restaurants nearby. Service at night at the bar right on the beach is great. I have stayed at most hotels in Cancun and the Presidente is my favorite. You cannot go wrong choosing this hotel.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico

10,3/7/2022,Our stay at the Intercontinental Presidente was phenomenal. The beach area around the property is beautiful. The food and service was great. We had a classic king room with an outside area. The room was always cleaned to perfection and fhe room was always cold. They have 2 pools and 5 hot tubs on top of dozens of cabanas with laying chairs. Never had a hard time finding one. The drinks were great. It's walking distance to many nearby restaurants. You can easily get on the bus to go other places. The restaurant inside the hotel even has tables on the beach and we had a romantic dinner on the beach on our last night. Don't second guess yourself and just book it. You won't regret it. Cannot wait to return!,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico
10,2/7/2022,"Nice property with excellent service, beautiful beach, and great swimming pool. The beach did not have seaweed and the water was very clear. The ratio of beach area to number of guests is lower than other resorts, avoiding an over crowded beach. This is an old hotel that was nicely renovated. The food was okay.

10,23-06-2022,Great property with many amenities. The beach area was spacious and the staff was very helpful. Only downside is the lack of privacy of the bathroom in the suite. The bathroom features frosted glass and a window in the shower.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico
8,22-06-2022,"Beautiful ambiance and the property is well-kept. Pool area is clean. Restaurant attached to the hotel is pretty good, delicious breakfast in the morning. Only thing that left something to be desired was the smell of mold in the hotel rooms. We had an ocean view and it was a beautiful room aside from the overpowering smell. It gave me asthma and my clothes still reeked of mold when I got back to the U.S.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico

I was disappointed at the quality of food from room service - ordered a steak sandwich but the steak tasted like rubber, not real steak, also very expensive. Food in general I found very expensive - not reasonable with the quality being served. Additionally what sold me on the property was the jacuzzi - only to find out it was additional cost.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico
10,20-06-2022,"This property was clean, hosted me graciously and I felt safe while vacationing on the resort. The prices at the restaurants were high, but not unexpected for the quality of food served. I enjoyed my short stay and would rebook here again.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico

10,14-06-2022,"Surprised to say the least! I came here to celebrate my birthday and this hotel went above and beyond. Let me start by saying, I had a surprised birthday cake waiting for me in my room when I came back from my excursion. Almost all of the staff wore mask even in the heat, outside and on the beach. The ribeye was good at restaurant - Urbano and the outside pool bar. The drinks was well made and can we talk about how great the sauna, steam room and massage by Lenny was. Everything was amazing including the nurse who completed my covid test on-site. This hotel has 2 large pools, 5 mini pool pods as I call them, 4-5 places to eat from, spa and etc. Bell man was great with identifying your transportation when they picked you up. My bill was correct with charges to my room, my bed was comfy and rooms very spacious. The hotel is gorgeous at night. Lifeguards for the beach area. Staff remember my name throughout my day!!! This hotel is less than 30 minutes from the airport and 15 minute walk from Coco Bongo party district. Pharmacy and mini store is less than 5 minutes walk across the hotel. You would have to leave the hotel if you choose to stay here and relax. Playa de Carmen was about an hour ride.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico
10,13-06-2022,"When we checked into the resort, the view from the room was of a wall considering we reserved a terrace view. We were able to upgrade to a suite with a ocean/resort view which was perfect!",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico
10,13-06-2022,"En lo general fue todo muy bien. Cumplió con nuestras expectativas . Habitación amplia y cómoda. Albercas muy bien, y la comida de muy buena calidad.

10,20-05-2022,I traveled solo and asked for a king size bed with a terrace. The room was spacious and clean. The resort grounds are very beautiful and well-maintained. While there was a slight delay at check-in I was able to get some work done in the business center while I waited. Servers at the free breakfast each morning are attentive and efficient. There’s an omelette station lots of fruit in each morning is a different Mexican dish. The chicken with moly sauce was excellent! The property is at the end of the entertainment strip leading to a quiet exclusive beachfront property. Security patrol all night keeping us safe. The property is also right across the street from a 24 hour gas station that has a subway and there’s some restaurants at all on that block they have a variety of food from Mexican to Italian is pizza right there. So if you are like me looking for a resort that has free breakfast and then other dining options and drink options it’s all right there for you. The exit Covid testing is only $20 cash or charge. The results returned within 30 minutes and you can get a print out if you requested. Plus they’ll send you emails with your documentation as well. The refrigerator in the room has enough space for you to fit a 2 L bottle in it standing up. So there’s plenty of space there for you to have your other food if you need it. I would definitely stay here again the price was reasonable. And the accommodations were comfortable clean and beautiful. The staff was very friendly.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico
10,20-05-2022,"Great location and a beautiful beach with white sand.

6,15-05-2022,2nd floor had doors cracked and you can see right through the cracks into the room. Food was very pricey and small amounts. Had good security who watch you at the beach and in the front of the hotel.  Beach was clean and beautiful.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico
8,14-05-2022,"The hotel is well run and the common areas are delightful. The big problem with the hotel is the terrible and overwhelming smell of mold in the hallways and rooms. If you have a sensitivity to mold you must avoid this hotel bc it will make you sick. It is too bad that the management is as shortsighted as to keep the mold this intensely unpleasant. I only stayed one night in transit, but I would have to book something else if I was here for a week. The rooms are okay but not fancy.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico
10,13-05-2022,"Wonderful stay! Property is about a 10-15 min walk from the busy hotel zone which is a big party at nighttime. We like being away from the hustle and bustle. The beach area is amazing with plenty of chairs and umbrellas for shade. We were always able to get a place to sit on the beach. Pool areas are well kept. You can also take a local bus to the center of the city if you want to explore. Overall, great location if you want to be within walking distance to everything but far away enough that you can enjoy peace and quiet.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico

10,10/5/2022,Awesome,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico
10,9/5/2022,"Our first impression is that the hotel has very good maintenance. It looks very clean and smells pretty good.
Reception was very kind. However, they informed us that the included breakfast only covered the 2 adults, the 3yo child will eat for free, but we had to pay breakfast for the 6yo. I didn't find it fair, as we expected to have all the family covered by the price we paid.
We contacted Expedia, and the agreed that they will cover extra expenses for our son's breakfast.
The room is comfortable, although I didn't like much the bathroom setup. The toilet/shower door is a sliding one, and it can't be locked (No privacy). The shower doesn't have a door, so the water spills out.
It has a small fridge (That wasn't correctly plugged when we arrived, so we had to move the fridge, and plug it in from the back). Luckily we didn't have any food that could get spoiled.
Next, the Pool. It has two pools, but we used only one. It's fantastic, especially for kids, as it's shallow. There are about 4 Jacuzzi next to that pool, so you can sit there and relax.
The Beach is the best in that area. Sand is pristine, and there are few waves (again, perfect for small children). We always found chairs to sit by the beach.
The food was excellent, and the service was great.There are about 4 restaurants, and enough variety of dishes. There's always something for kids.
Everyone was nice and eager to provide a good service.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico

- room was rundown and very tired looking
- there were stains and dirt on curtains and bench upholstery in the room
- ground floor wing and our room had a musty, damp smell.

8,8/4/2022,"Our stay was really good. When we first arrived, the check in process was slower than you would expect but when we got to the front the service was good. Our room overlooked the parking lot, which was fine I guess as we didn’t select a more expensive room, but needed to use ear plugs to drown out traffic on street noise. The room was good, but it had a damp smell and also the bathroom fan did not work. I asked the front desk about it and someone came up and put febreze or something in the room and it smelled better. We also opened the window to air it out, and the next day the room smelled good. Very comfortable beds and nice sheets. Nice big shower with lots of hot water. The outside resort area looked like the photos - was stunning. And the beach was great and they kept it relatively clean of sargassum. The beach was wonderful. We went for a walk down the beach and looking at other resorts, we were relieved with our decision as our beach area was so much nicer. They kept the chairs a little social distanced, while the others were packed like sardines. We wished the hotel enforced the no smoking policy. The food at the hotel restaurants did not have good selections especially for plant based people - not even one choice. So we had to leave the resort to eat. Chedauri supermarket food court on the 3rd floor - get yourself a great bottle of wine from the floor (amazing selection) and then order your food and sit outside with your wine! Casa Tequila was also good.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico

The beach is a step away from the pools.  I usually like to see TVs at the outside bar in case a sports event is on but I understand if they want all focus away from that because it’s vacation.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico

O erro do hotel é não ter cadeiras e guarda sol suficiente para todos os hóspedes na praia. Bem localizado e praia boa.

10,25-02-2022,"First time in Cancun; all I wanted was a nice beach, a clean hotel, and good food. And this hotel met and exceeded my expectations.
First of all, I think for the price, it was in the best location.  Just by looking out along the coast, they have the widest stretch of beach. I love the walkways along the sand, esp helpful during the hot summer months. I loved sitting under thatched roofs, near the water. I love that everything was compact-just a few steps and you're near the bar and food. Or someone comes over to take your order. Restaurants: I thought food was good in all the restaurants. Price is something that you would expect in a hotel restaurant though-not cheap.But right outside the hotel, just a few feet away are some local eateries if you want cheaper food. Rooms-we had a 2 queens room with ocean views. When we booked I believe we got the last in that category. So we got the 2nd floor with a limited ocean view. But I thought the room was big, clean, and well-appointed. Just maybe add another glass door in the shower(instead of halfway glassed in) and bigger/more trash cans with separate ones for recycling. I felt bad mixing plastic with the regular trash.
All in all, I highly recommend staying here.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico

10,2/2/2022,"This is a very chill, relaxed hotel in my opinion. Nobody bothered us with bracelets, keys etc.. You just check in, and enjoy your time.. The pool are OK, they could be a bit warmer I guess so you could spend more time there playing with kids, they are a bit chill, and ""hot"" tubs have the same temperature as the pools. 

But other than that - we liked everything about it. It's about 10 minute walk to the center of it all - coco bongo, hooters, supermarket - but I wouldn't bother going there much anyways, just a bunch of tourist trap restaurants where they rip you off on exchange rates 
There is a little food court type of building (cross road and turn right when you exit and it's 1 minute walk) - bunch of food stalls where you can grab a bite for cheap. Don't hesitate to go into gas station in front of the hotel - good prices on beer. And there is oxxo convenience store probably 3 minute walk. So everything you might need (including that huge supermarket I mentioned) is within 10-15 minute walk. 

But hotel itself as I said is very laid back, plenty of beach chairs for guests and if there are not enough - just ask, I saw them taking out more. That area with chairs on the beach is better than the 3 times more expensive Grand Fiesta America where we stayed afterwards.
Oh, and the water is calm here, so it's perfect for the kids.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico

The hotel is located in a great area that offers an amazing beach access just a short walk from your room. The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming. We had dinner and breakfast at the main restaurant and the staff always went above and beyond to make us feel great. Our waiters Gustavo and David were amazing. They greeted us every day as if they we’re truly happy to see us. They even sang my wife happy birthday and brought us a complimentary dessert.

4,2/1/2022,"For a USD$856 hotel room, I expected better. Perhaps something clean with nice room service? I am not a picky traveler, but the room was so tired that I questioned whether I had teleported. Stains everywhere. The breakfast was disappointing as well, so no, not worth it by a long shot. The only thing that saved this hotel for me was the nice beach, so if you'll be spending most of your time there, I suppose it could work out well. I stayed one night before I moved to another place. It was peak season so very few places were available, but I found a USD$63/night bed and breakfast with a better looking room where I spent the rest of my vacation.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico
10,1/1/2022,"Our stay at the hotel was amazing, and from the walks we took along the beaches, it has one of the nicest beaches of the resorts. My wife commented it was the nicest beach she has ever enjoyed. The staff was courteous, attentive, and made sure our needs were met.

The staff were not helpful especially when I came alittle early to ask to be checked in early, I knew she had rooms available but she said No and told me to come back at 3.

When we asked two ladies at the front desk where we could have dinner they pointed us to the beach restaurant but never mentioned there was a second restaurant open and also a nice bar. I figured it out by myself later in the evening and confirmed it with the waiter that said two restaurants were open plus the bar. It's a shame as we had already eaten at the beach restaurant that same day and would have been happy to experience something else. Same for breakfast the next day, confusion on where we could go. The hotel lacks ""life"" in their f&b outlets. Apart from this great hotel with great location.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico

10,10/12/2021,"The hotel is very nice has an amazing entrance the staff is super friendly and always willing to help. What i didnt like is that is not all inclusive the only package i saw while i was booking the room was the buffet breakfast which by the way is not a bad buffet food was good and differente variety, but thats all they have and on property there is 3 restaurant which i only visit 2 in my 7 nights stay. The caribeño and cafe urbano. At the caribeño is where the breakfast buffet is offer i had a very romantic diner with my girlfriend at the beach with a bottle of moet ,food for $150 overall good restaurant great service and the prices are not as bad typical to all prices at cancun that by the way is a very ""expensive"" place to visit. Cafe urbano had breakfast twice at my stay also not bad at all will recomended with $23 or less you will have a decent breakfast. Other than that i have nothing negative to say  room was cleaned by stff everyday and i was very satisfied with everything.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico

2,18-09-2021,"I'm horrified by my 1 night stay! The check in process, which took 45+ min., was a disaster! Staff was not properly trained. I was initially given the wrong room. So I had to go complain and was eventually given the room I paid for. That was a 1.5-hour waste of time! Once I finally got settled, I took a lap around the hotel. Overall, I was not impressed with the cleaning-less of the place, carpets smelled and looked dirt, pool was cloudy and gross looking, windows were dirty and not cleaned, shower was moldy and growing, beach was a mess and was the nastiest thing I've even seen! Smelled like a rotten whale from the seaweed and dirt on the sand. Looked like it had not been cleaned in days. But that was nothing compared to what I found later! After dinner, I decided to use the restroom in my room. What I found was the most disgusting/unacceptable thing I have ever encountered! There was a wipe of human feces on the wall next to the toilet! THATS RIGTH! HUMAN POOP! From the previous guests! See attached pictures. I immediately went to front desk and showed pictures. I was met with no sympathy and was offered to have a housekeeper come and wipe it off, which should have been done while the room was cleaned and not after guests are checked in! This is extra disturbing during a pandemic, which cleaning is ""supposed"" to be enhanced! I checked out the next morning and have not yet been given a refund for my second night. Avoid this place like the plague!",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico

6,15-09-2021,The property was quiet. A unique feature that I enjoyed. The music was at a minimum and not offensive. The beach had a smell of dead fish that the staff attributed to the hurricanes. Not good at all. No swimming my entire trip. In addition the food was terrible. Breakfast was the only good meal. We ended up having salad and leaving the resort to find food.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico

6,2/9/2021,"This is an 1970's Intercontinental. The smell, the rooms the pools, facade, etc. We originally got a room that was not cooling properly the maintenance man said it was. I told the front desk that I refused to pay $200 (tax included) for a room that's warmer than their lobby. Being and Intercontinental, they graciously changed the room. To a better room. Nothing significant but that's good service. Just lower your expectations. And don't compare this property to all the other newer properties around Cancun. For the money, I would skip it.

Lastly as of Sept 1, 2021 the beaches all around Cancun have huge alge growths... Impossible to swim in. This is due to Hurricane grace that just came through 2 weeks earlier.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico

4,27-08-2021,"Stayed 6 days during the week Hurricane Grace made landfall in the Yucatan peninsula. Fortunately, it was just a Category 1 storm when it reached Cancun on Wednesday night and was gone by early Thursday afternoon.  I have traveled extensively: By international standards this is NOT a 4-star hotel. I agree with some reviewers that this hotel is outdated and the rooms, though clean, need remodeling. For instance, there were some cracked and broken tiles in the shower and the tub was chipped in two places.  Yet on its website the Presidente Intercontinental Cancun Resort shows a picture bearing the caption NEWLY RENOVATED (sic). Moreover, the picture is deceiving because the areas to the right and left of the hotel are now densely developed:  How old is that picture? As for dining, guests can choose among El Caribeno, buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner; Le Cap Beach Club, casual dining; Café Urbano, breakfast a la carte and go-and-grab items. Generally speaking, the food quality was average, and food and drinks were overpriced. In contrast, restaurant Urbano offers a more varied menu and better food quality. It opened exceptionally for dinner on the evening of the hurricane, and for breakfast and lunch on the following day. The rest of the time access is reserved for IHG Rewards members. A word about El Caribeno: This is an open dining area with a palm-thatched roof. It is dark and old. The first morning I was there I looked up and saw the beams that support the palm-thatched",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico
2,25-08-2021,"Hotel did a very poor job of cleaning the beach after the hurricane. 5 days after the hurricane beach was still blocked and the small was very nasty by that time. We were not able to step into the water during our stay at all. Other neighboring hotels did a better job of cleaning the beach, so it was definitely lack of effort. 
Otherwise, the hotel is pretty nice, employees on reception are polite and attentive, but the",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico

Only 3 things to help improve: 1) the food option was poor and prices were excessively high for what you pay. 2) on the eco-friendly part, please stop putting plastic bottles of water and for shampoo/conditioner. 3) the taxi service is a total ripoff. 15$ for a 10 min trip where for locals the price is 6$. The hotel should make an effort to have a deal with the taxis to charge a reasonable price for hotel guests.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico

2,14-08-2021,"Plenty of food and drinks, but that's not included. You have to pay for water, $6.00 a bottle, said i had to pay cash because i had no credit card on file.( I paid for the 4 nights in cash and gave them my credit card for incidentals. Incidentals for this place i really don't know what they are, but after paying with cash in the beginning, I should have gotten a receipt. When i went to check out, there were $1100 extra charges on the card. I paid 2x for crap food room service on the card wich was around $80 the rest of any food or drinks were paid with cash. This place is NOT a resort,  its an over priced hotel with everyone asking for a tip. I have been in so many places in Cancun and riviera maya and NEVER had to do anything except for enjoy the day and night. No nightly shows, and it's 20 dollars to taxi to Senior Frog's and the other bars which was only a couple blocks away. They expected tips also, but that was ok by me. I had 1 lunch at the outside restaurant and it was...different. Not bad, I just never ate octopus salad. I think it was around $16 dollars a plate average. Then the last part is the worst. Checking out. She only spoke Spanish and I only know a little Spanish, so trying to read a receipt in Spanish and getting an answer in Spanish was pretty much impossible. No manager around to explain. And they didn't post the cash payment on it. They took the room off the credit card and said nothing about the cash paid upon check in.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico

Room was really clean, spacious with comfortable beds, and offered everything we could think of. Reception staff were more than helpful with anything we needed.
We visited the SPA a few times for massages, it was incredible, I would highly recommend a visit!
If we had one down side ( and it’s a stretch) it’s that the pool is too warm.

I checked in with my daughter and after begging to be placed in a room with two beds, I was placed in a room with no air conditioning. The temperature at that time in Cancun was more than 90 degrees. The room was an oven. Of course, they tried to fix the air conditioning but what was very disappointing is that the hotel had plenty of other rooms. The rooms need upgrading; the bedding and furniture need to be replaced. There are no enough lounge chairs either. I am not staying here ever again. There are many other hotels.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico

However,  the beach food was perfect for our relaxing days on the sand. I had an injured food and this hotel is well equiped with ramps and elevators to accommodate anyone with physical disabilities. Something other more fancy and more expensive hotels did not offer. The staff at Presidente were great, helpful, polite, and so sweet. We had a horrible experience staying at Xcaret Mexico for the first five nights of our vacation but Presidente Intercontinental saved our vacation from b3ing a complete disaster.
